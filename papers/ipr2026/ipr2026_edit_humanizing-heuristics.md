# Humanising Heuristics: Detecting and Revising AI-Generated Academic Text

**Purpose:** A field guide for identifying machine-generated patterns in academic writing and revising toward natural, human-authored prose. Synthesised from Wikipedia's "Signs of AI Writing" (Nov 2025), the VERMILLION framework, Liang et al. (2024), Kobak et al. (2025), and editorial practice.

**Core Principle:** No single marker proves AI authorship. Detection depends on *clustering*---when multiple markers co-occur within a paragraph or section, the cumulative signal is strong. Revision should eliminate clusters while preserving accuracy, meaning, and professional tone.

---

## 1. Lexical Markers (Word-Level)

### H1.1 Overused "AI-Tell" Words

Words that spiked 50--300% in published writing after ChatGPT's release (Liang et al. 2024; Kobak et al. 2025).

**Tier 1 --- Strongest signals** (10x+ overrepresentation):
- delve, underscores, multifaceted, comprehensive, crucial, notably, landscape, tapestry, realm, pivotal, nuanced, testament, beacon, embark

**Tier 2 --- Strong signals:**
- foster, harness, leverage, navigate, showcase, streamline, bolster, elevate, intersection, cutting-edge, groundbreaking, transformative, unveil, robust, holistic, innovative, mitigate, imperative, burgeon, poised

**Tier 3 --- Moderate signals** (common in academic writing but flagged when clustered):
- furthermore, moreover, additionally, consequently, significantly, importantly, notably, crucially, remarkably, ultimately, effectively, employ, utilize, align, encounter, essential, invaluable, pioneering

**Fix:** Replace with plainer synonyms or delete. "Comprehensive" -> "broad" / "wide-ranging" / "integrated". "Navigate" -> "manage" / "handle". "Landscape" -> "environment" / "field". "Robust" -> "strong" / "solid". If a word appears 3+ times, vary replacements.

### H1.2 Inflated-Importance Phrases

Hollow intensifiers that claim significance without demonstrating it:

- "pivotal step / moment / role"
- "major turning point"
- "underscoring the importance"
- "serves as a testament to"
- "marks a crucial phase"
- "reflects the continued relevance of"
- "highlights the significance of"
- "represents a paradigm shift"
- "plays a critical role in shaping"
- "it's important to note / remember / consider"
- "no discussion would be complete without"

**Fix:** Delete the intensifier and let the evidence speak. If the claim needs an intensifier to sound important, the evidence is probably insufficient.

### H1.3 Hollow-Analysis Participles

Present participles that gesture at analysis without performing it:

- "highlighting the need for..."
- "showcasing the potential of..."
- "reflecting broader trends in..."
- "underscoring the challenges of..."
- "emphasising the significance of..."
- "ensuring..."
- "improving convenience"

**Fix:** Replace the participle clause with a specific causal or evidential statement. Say *what* it highlights and *why*, or cut the clause entirely.

### H1.4 Copula Avoidance (Wikipedia Pattern 8)

AI avoids simple "is/was/are" in favour of elaborate constructions:

- "serves as" / "stands as" / "functions as" / "is positioned as"
- "constituting" / "representing" / "reflecting"

**Fix:** Use the simple copula. "The office serves as a regulatory body" -> "The office is a regulatory body."

### H1.5 Promotional / Inflated Tone (Wikipedia Pattern 4)

Copywriting register in academic prose:

- "breathtaking," "rich tapestry," "cutting-edge," "stunning"
- "boasts a range of," "the world's first," "the most comprehensive"
- "enduring / lasting legacy," "rich cultural tapestry"

**Fix:** Delete all promotional language. Replace with precise, measured description.

---

## 2. Syntactic Markers (Sentence-Level)

### H2.1 Excessive Em-Dashes

AI overuses em-dashes (---) to insert asides where commas, colons, semicolons, or separate sentences would be more natural. Human writers use em-dashes sparingly for emphasis; AI uses them as a structural crutch.

**Threshold:** >2--3 em-dash pairs per 1,000 words is elevated; >5 is a strong signal.

**Fix:** Replace most with commas, colons, parentheses, or full stops. Reserve em-dashes for genuine rhetorical emphasis (at most one per page).

### H2.2 Uniform Sentence Length and Rhythm

AI produces sentences of 18--25 words with monotonous SVO rhythm. Human writing varies dramatically---short punchy sentences for emphasis, long complex sentences for nuance.

**Test:** Low standard deviation (< 5 words) in sentence lengths across multiple paragraphs.

**Fix:** Deliberately vary sentence length. Combine two short sentences. Break a long one. Start with subordinate clauses, prepositional phrases, or the subject.

### H2.3 Echoed Sentence Structures (Parallelism Overuse)

Repeating the same syntactic template across consecutive sentences:

> *"The EU prioritises safety. The US prioritises innovation. China prioritises competitiveness."*

**Fix:** Vary the syntax. Use different clause structures. Embed one comparison inside a longer sentence.

### H2.4 Rule-of-Three Lists (Tricolons)

AI defaults to groups of three items ("speed, quality, and efficiency"; "innovation, safety, and interoperability") far more often than human writers. Typical human academic papers: ~5--8% tricolon rate. AI papers: 15--20%.

**Fix:** Vary list lengths. Use pairs, quartets, or irregular groupings. Or collapse a list into prose.

### H2.5 Semicolon Triplets

AI uses semicolon-separated lists of three: "X does A; Y does B; and Z does C."

**Fix:** Break into separate sentences with varied structures.

### H2.6 Colon-Heavy Constructions

AI frequently structures sentences as "X: Y" to introduce explanations.

**Fix:** Vary with subordinate clauses, appositive phrases, or separate sentences.

### H2.7 Negative Parallelism (Wikipedia Pattern 9)

"Not merely/only X---it is Y" and "Not just X but also Y" structures. Wikipedia identifies this as "the most prominent AI writing tell."

**Fix:** Restructure. "Both X and Y" or simply state Y directly.

---

## 3. Structural Markers (Paragraph and Section-Level)

### H3.1 Uniform Paragraph Length

AI produces paragraphs of nearly identical length (4--6 sentences, 80--120 words). Human writing mixes long analytical paragraphs with short emphatic ones.

**Test:** If >70% of paragraphs are within +/-20% of the median length, the text is suspiciously uniform.

**Fix:** Merge some short paragraphs. Split some long ones. Occasionally use a one- or two-sentence paragraph for emphasis.

### H3.2 Excessive Sub-Headings

AI over-segments with sub-headings every 150--300 words. Academic papers typically use fewer section breaks and rely on topic sentences and transitions.

**Test:** Sub-heading-to-page ratio >3:1 (excluding mandatory sections).

**Fix:** Merge related subsections. Use topic sentences instead of headers for minor transitions.

### H3.3 Formulaic Section Openings

- "This section examines..."
- "In this section, we..."
- "Having established X, we now turn to Y."
- "Building on the analysis above..."
- "A clear pattern emerges."

**Fix:** Start with a specific claim, question, counterargument, or concrete example.

### H3.4 Absent Short Paragraphs

Human writers use one- or two-sentence paragraphs for pacing and emphasis. AI almost never produces these. Their complete absence is a signal.

### H3.5 Symmetrical Case Treatment (Mirror Structures)

When comparing multiple cases, AI produces near-identical section structures: same number of subsections, same ordering of topics, same paragraph count.

**Fix:** Allow case sections to differ in structure and length. Adapt structure to the material.

---

## 4. Discourse Markers (Transitions and Connectives)

### H4.1 Rigid Formulaic Transitions

AI over-relies on a small set of connectives at paragraph boundaries:

- Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally, Consequently, Nevertheless, In contrast, Similarly, Importantly, Notably, Crucially, Conversely

**Test:** >30% of paragraphs opening with these connectives.

**Fix:** Delete most. Use demonstrative pronouns ("This pattern..."), echo a keyword, or juxtapose paragraphs and trust the reader.

### H4.2 Excessive Hedging

Reflexive rather than strategic hedging:

- "arguably," "it could be said that," "it is worth noting that," "perhaps," "might," "potentially"

**Fix:** Remove hedges not doing epistemic work. State confident claims directly.

### H4.3 "The" as Paragraph Opener

AI starts >25% of paragraphs with "The." Human writers vary more.

**Fix:** Vary paragraph openings with prepositional phrases, adverbial clauses, proper nouns, or short emphatic sentences.

---

## 5. Rhetorical and Tonal Markers

### H5.1 Excessive Neutrality / Fence-Sitting

Presenting "on the one hand... on the other hand" without resolving. Academic papers should have a thesis.

**Fix:** After presenting competing views, state which the evidence supports.

### H5.2 Missing Personal Voice

AI-generated text lacks distinctive authorial voice. Reads as competent but generic.

**Fix:** Introduce occasional first-person commentary. Use field-specific jargon. Allow some stylistic irregularity.

### H5.3 Vague Summaries

Conclusions that could apply to any paper:

> *"This analysis highlights the complex interplay between innovation and regulation, underscoring the need for balanced approaches."*

**Fix:** Replace with specific claims tied to specific evidence from the paper.

### H5.4 Filler Phrases (Wikipedia Pattern 22)

Verbose padding:

- "in rapidly changing world markets"
- "due to its ability to"
- "in order to" (-> "to")
- "it is important to note that" (-> delete)
- "a wide range of" (-> delete or specify)

**Fix:** Cut ruthlessly. If removing the phrase changes nothing, it was filler.

---

## 6. Mechanical / Formatting Markers

### H6.1 Curly vs. Straight Quotation Marks

Inconsistent Unicode curly quotes vs. LaTeX-style quotes within a document.

### H6.2 Unnatural Title Capitalisation

AI capitalises every word in headings ("The Impact Of Regulatory Frameworks On Innovation") rather than using sentence case or house style.

### H6.3 Excessive Bullet Points

AI defaults to bullets for any enumeration. Academic prose typically embeds lists in running text.

**Fix:** Convert bullet lists to prose where items form a continuous argument.

### H6.4 Bold-Title Bullet Points (Wikipedia Pattern 10)

ChatGPT-style formatting: **Bold phrase:** followed by a sentence restating the bold phrase.

**Fix:** Remove the bold or integrate into running text.

---

## 7. Academic-Specific Markers

### H7.1 Citation-Claim Mismatch

AI attributes claims to citations that don't support them or generates non-existent references.

**Fix:** Verify every citation against the actual source.

### H7.2 Over-Signposting

AI over-explains paper structure: "In Section 3, we will discuss... In Section 4, we turn to..."

**Fix:** One roadmap paragraph in the introduction is sufficient.

### H7.3 Symmetrical Case Treatment

Near-identical section structures for each compared case.

**Fix:** Adapt structure to material. Give more space to richer or more complex cases.

### H7.4 Vague Attribution (Wikipedia Pattern 7)

Weasel wording suggesting authority without sources:

- "Industry reports," "Observers have cited," "Some critics argue"

**Fix:** Cite specific sources or delete.

---

## 8. Domain-Specific Vocabulary Patterns

### H8.1 "Landscape" Metaphor

"Regulatory landscape," "threat landscape," "policy landscape" -- top AI-tell metaphor.

**Fix:** Replace with "environment," "field," "context," or more specific terms.

### H8.2 "Ecosystem" as Generic Container

Used for any collection of related things.

**Fix:** Be specific: "the lobbying industry," "the open-source community," etc.

### H8.3 "Framework" Overuse

Partly unavoidable in regulatory analysis but should be varied with "regime," "system," "apparatus," "arrangement," "architecture."

---

## 9. Paper-Specific Flags (from prior audit)

These patterns were specifically flagged in the multi-paper humanisation review:

1. **Tricolons at 17%** -- 38 tricolon sentences across 229 sentences. Target: reduce to 8--10%.
2. **"Not merely/only...but" x6** -- especially in discussion/conclusion. Classic AI escalation.
3. **"Framework" x38** -- vary with "regime," "system," "apparatus."
4. **"While" as contrastive conjunction x12** -- vary with "but," "yet," "though," or restructure.
5. **"The" as paragraph opener x22/80** -- reduce to <15%.
6. **Abstract has highest AI density** -- 4 tricolons in ~150 words. Rewrite with more voice.

---

## 10. Application Protocol

### Pass 1 --- Scan and Flag
Read the full text and mark every instance of markers from categories 1--8 plus paper-specific flags. Use annotations (e.g., `[H1.1]` for Tier 1 word, `[H2.1]` for em-dash). Count cluster density per section.

### Pass 2 --- Revise Flagged Passages
For each flagged passage, apply the corresponding "Fix" guidance. Prioritise clusters (3+ markers within a single paragraph) over isolated instances. **Do not change facts, statistics, citations, or substantive content.**

### Pass 3 --- Read Aloud and Vary
Read the revised text aloud. Listen for rhythmic monotony, repeated sentence openings, and passages that "sound like a chatbot." Break up remaining uniformity with deliberate variation in sentence length, paragraph length, and transition strategy.
