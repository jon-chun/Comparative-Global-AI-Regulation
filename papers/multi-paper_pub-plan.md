## 1. Paper Portfolio

Three papers derive from the same underlying research programme --- a comparative analysis of AI regulatory frameworks in the EU, China, and the United States --- but each targets a different audience, employs a different analytical framework, and makes a different original contribution.

| # | Paper | Venue | Status | Words |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | arXiv preprint | arXiv (2410.21279) | **Published** (Oct 2024) | ~7,500 |
| 2 | IPR paper | Internet Policy Review | **Ready for submission** | 7,726 |
| 3 | JCP paper | Journal of Cyber Policy | **Ready for submission** | 6,100 |

## 2. Differentiation Matrix

| Dimension | arXiv Preprint | IPR Paper | JCP Paper |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Title** | Comparative Global AI Regulation: Policy Perspectives from the EU, China, and the US | (same) | The Cyber Governance Trilemma: Comparative AI Regulation in the EU, China, and the United States |
| **Target audience** | General AI/ML community | Internet policy scholars, EU policymakers | Cyber governance community, defence/security analysts, diplomats |
| **Theoretical framework** | None | 3 lenses: regulatory competition, governance typology, innovation--safety tradeoff | 4 lenses: adds regime complexity (Nye), cyber sovereignty (DeNardis, Mueller), grounded in Majone/Levi-Faur |
| **Central argument** | Descriptive survey | Multipolar regulatory landscape; Brussels Effect is limited | Cyber governance trilemma (innovation / safety / interoperability); formally argued mechanism |
| **Original contribution** | First systematic 3-way comparison | Governance typology; 2025 regulatory updates | Trilemma thesis; comparative regulatory timeline dataset; developing-nations cascade analysis; AI-cyber conflict analysis |
| **Policy implications** | Generic (2 paragraphs) | European policy (4 paragraphs) | International cyber governance (6 paragraphs): fragmentation as cyber risk, transatlantic/China, developing nations (5 countries/blocs), norm-building, military AI |
| **Citation style** | natbib/plainnat (in-text) | biblatex APA 7th (in-text) | Chatham House numbered endnotes |
| **Language** | American English | American English | British English |
| **Methodology** | Implicit | Explicit (comparative case study) | Explicit with cyber governance research design and timeline dataset methodology |
| **Currency** | Through Oct 2024 | Through late 2025 | Through late 2025 |
| **SB 1047 accuracy** | Incorrect ("awaits signature") | Corrected (vetoed Sep 2024) | Corrected |

## 3. Self-Plagiarism Assessment

### 3.1 Estimated Textual Overlap

| Paper Pair | Overlap | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| arXiv vs IPR | ~60--65% | IPR is a substantial revision of arXiv. T&F and IPR both permit arXiv preprints. Acceptable: the preprint is a draft version, not a separate publication. |
| arXiv vs JCP | ~25--30% | JCP is a thorough reframing. Shared empirical base but different thesis, framework, and conclusions. Acceptable. |
| **IPR vs JCP** | **~15--20%** | **Most relevant comparison.** After all revisions, overlap is confined to factual descriptions of regulatory instruments. Analytical framing, theoretical apparatus, original contributions, discussion, and conclusions are entirely different. |

### 3.2 Verdict

**Both the IPR and JCP papers can be submitted independently without self-plagiarism.**

The academic standard for publishing from the same research programme across multiple venues requires that each paper makes a distinct analytical contribution to a distinct audience. This criterion is met:

1. **Different theses.** IPR argues for a multipolar regulatory landscape with European policy implications. JCP argues for a cyber governance trilemma with international security implications.
2. **Different theoretical apparatus.** JCP adds regime complexity, cyber sovereignty, and comparative regulatory capitalism grounding --- none present in IPR. The IPR paper has no cyber governance analysis.
3. **Different original contributions.** JCP contributes the trilemma concept, the regulatory timeline dataset, developing-nations cascade analysis, and the AI-cyber conflict subsection. IPR contributes the governance typology application and EU implementation analysis.
4. **Different audiences.** Internet policy scholars (IPR) vs cyber governance practitioners and security analysts (JCP). Minimal readership overlap.
5. **Different conclusions.** European policy recommendations (IPR) vs international cyber governance implications (JCP).
6. **Below overlap threshold.** At ~15--20%, textual overlap is below the informal ~25% threshold at which editors flag concern.

**Recommended disclosure:** Both the arXiv preprint and the IPR companion paper should be disclosed in the JCP cover letter (drafted at `papers/jcp2026/cover-letter.md`). The IPR submission need not disclose the JCP paper, but should note the arXiv preprint.

## 4. Submission Timeline

Both JCP and IPR operate on **rolling review** --- neither has fixed submission deadlines. This simplifies timing: the papers can be submitted concurrently.

### 4.1 Recommended Sequence

| Week | Action | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Week 0** (now) | Send inquiry to JCP | Email Joyce Hakmeh (commissioning editor) with paper summary. Gauge editorial appetite before formal submission. Draft at `papers/jcp2026/email-hakmeh.md`. |
| **Week 0** | Submit IPR paper | IPR paper (`papers/ipr2026/`) is ready. Submit via ScholarOne or IPR's submission portal. Include note disclosing arXiv preprint. |
| **Week 1--2** | Await JCP editorial signal | If positive: proceed to full submission. If negative: pivot to alternative venues (see Section 5). |
| **Week 2--3** | Submit JCP paper | Submit full manuscript with cover letter disclosing arXiv preprint and IPR companion paper. |
| **Weeks 4--12** | Peer review (both journals) | JCP: review model not disclosed; expect 8--12 weeks. IPR: expect 6--10 weeks. |
| **Weeks 12--16** | Revise and resubmit | Address reviewer comments. The distinct framing of each paper means R&R requests will be independent. |
| **Weeks 16--24** | Acceptance/publication | Both journals have relatively fast post-acceptance production. |

### 4.2 Timing Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IPR published before JCP review** | 30% | JCP reviewers see published IPR paper and flag overlap | Cover letter proactively discloses IPR; overlap at ~15--20% is below concern threshold |
| **JCP editor rejects on fit** | 15% | No JCP submission | Inquiry email (Week 0) tests fit before formal submission; pivot venues available |
| **Reviewer at both journals** | 5% | Same person reviews both papers | Extremely unlikely given different disciplines; distinct framing makes independent evaluation straightforward |
| **Both rejected** | 10% | Need alternative venues | Fallback venues identified (Section 5) |

### 4.3 Concurrent Submission Ethics

Neither JCP nor IPR prohibits concurrent submission of **different** papers to **different** journals. The ethical constraint is against submitting the **same** paper to multiple venues simultaneously. Since the two papers make distinct contributions (verified in Section 3), concurrent submission is permissible and disclosed in the JCP cover letter.

## 5. Fallback Venues

If either paper is rejected, alternative venues are ranked by fit:

### For the JCP paper (cyber governance framing)

| Journal | Fit | IF | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| *International Affairs* (Chatham House) | Strong | 5.0 | Higher prestige; same publisher; same citation style |
| *Regulation & Governance* (Wiley) | Strong | 4.4 | Comparative regulation focus |
| *Computer Law & Security Review* (Elsevier) | Good | 3.2 | Published Veale & Borgesius on AI Act |
| *Policy & Internet* (Wiley) | Good | 4.1 | Technology policy focus |

### For the IPR paper (internet policy framing)

| Journal | Fit | IF | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| *Policy & Internet* (Wiley) | Strong | 4.1 | Closest alternative to IPR |
| *Telecommunications Policy* (Elsevier) | Good | 5.6 | Broader but strong digital policy coverage |
| *Government Information Quarterly* (Elsevier) | Good | 7.4 | Higher IF; digital government focus |
