Dear Ms Hakmeh,

I am writing on behalf of my co-authors, Dr Christian Schroeder de Witt (University of Oxford) and Professor Katherine Elkins (Kenyon College), to inquire whether the *Journal of Cyber Policy* might be interested in a paper on AI regulation as a cyber governance challenge.

Our paper, "The Cyber Governance Trilemma: Comparative AI Regulation in the EU, China, and the United States," presents a systematic comparative analysis of the three most influential AI regulatory regimes, updated through late 2025. We argue that these jurisdictions face an inherent *cyber governance trilemma*: no jurisdiction can simultaneously optimise innovation speed, safety and rights protection, and regulatory interoperability. The EU prioritises safety at the cost of innovation velocity; the US prioritises innovation at the cost of consistent safety guarantees; China prioritises state-directed competitiveness at the cost of international interoperability. This regulatory fragmentation is itself a cyber risk, creating compliance gaps that sophisticated threat actors can exploit.

The paper draws on regulatory competition theory, regime complexity (Nye), and comparative regulatory capitalism (Majone, Levi-Faur), and includes a comparative regulatory timeline dataset covering 22 milestones across the three jurisdictions from 2016 to 2026. We conclude with implications for international cyber governance---including transatlantic coordination, developing-nation model adoption (covering Brazil, India, Singapore, the African Union, and ASEAN), and AI-enabled cyber conflict.

We believe this paper would be well suited to JCP's cross-disciplinary mission, and we note its potential relevance to the journal's 10-year anniversary reflections on how cyber policy challenges have evolved. The full manuscript is approximately 6,100 words and is ready for submission.

A brief note on our team: I serve as lead investigator for the Modern Language Association's participation in the NIST US AI Safety Institute, with a background in cybersecurity and FinTech. Dr Schroeder de Witt leads the Oxford Witt Lab for Trust in AI and advises RAND, the BBC, and the UK government on AI governance. Professor Elkins co-leads our work with NIST and the IBM--Notre Dame Tech Ethics Lab.

I would be grateful for any guidance on whether this topic falls within JCP's current editorial interests, and whether you would welcome a full manuscript submission or prefer an abstract for pre-screening.

With best regards,
