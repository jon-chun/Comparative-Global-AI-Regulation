**Abstract (249 words)**

Artificial intelligence regulation has become inseparable from cyber governance. AI systems now defend critical infrastructure, generate sophisticated cyber threats, and mediate the information ecosystems on which democratic societies depend. Yet the frameworks governing AI development and deployment are fragmenting along geopolitical lines---creating a new form of systemic cyber risk.

This paper presents a systematic comparative analysis of the three most influential AI regulatory regimes: the EU AI Act, China's sector-specific regulations integrated with its Cybersecurity Law, and the evolving US approach spanning Executive Order #14110, its revocation under the Trump administration, and state-level initiatives including California's SB 53 and New York's RAISE Act. Drawing on regulatory competition theory, comparative regulatory capitalism, and Nye's regime complexity framework, we argue that these jurisdictions face a *cyber governance trilemma*: no jurisdiction can simultaneously optimise innovation speed, safety and rights protection, and regulatory interoperability. The EU prioritises safety at the cost of innovation velocity; the US prioritises innovation at the cost of consistent safety guarantees; China prioritises state-directed competitiveness at the cost of international interoperability.

As an original empirical contribution, the paper includes a comparative regulatory timeline documenting the accelerating pace and growing divergence of AI governance activity across all three jurisdictions from 2016 to 2026. Updated through late 2025, the analysis concludes with implications for international cyber governance, transatlantic coordination, and developing nations navigating between competing regulatory models.
