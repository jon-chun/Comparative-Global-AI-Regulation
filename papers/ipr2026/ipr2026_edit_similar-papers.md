## 1. CRITICALITY 98 -- Structure

**Issue:** Paper is drastically under word count -- approximately half the IPR norm.

**Evidence:** Our body text (Introduction through Discussion/Conclusion, including table prose) totals approximately 5,400 words. The IPR norm from the three comparable papers is 10,000--12,000 words (Crum ~9,500; Kira ~11,500; Roberts et al. ~12,500). Our paper is roughly 5,000--6,500 words short.

Breakdown of word counts by section:
- Introduction: ~470 words
- Theoretical Framework: ~590 words
- Methodology: ~300 words
- EU section (all subsections): ~1,090 words
- China section (all subsections): ~1,030 words
- US section (all subsections): ~950 words
- Discussion/Conclusion (all subsections): ~950 words

**Norm:** Crum's three analytical sections average ~2,600 words each. Kira's comparative analysis section alone is ~3,500 words. Roberts et al.'s UK governance section is ~1,800 words and their domestic challenges section is ~3,500 words. IPR papers sustain extended argumentative blocks of 1,800--3,500 words per major section.

**Fix:** Expand every major section substantially. Target approximately:
- Introduction: expand from ~470 to ~800 words (add explicit section roadmap; see Critique #3)
- Theoretical Framework: expand from ~590 to ~1,500 words (engage more deeply with Bradford, Smuha, Floridi as interlocutors; see Critique #8)
- Methodology: fold into Theoretical Framework or Introduction (see Critique #2)
- EU section: expand from ~1,090 to ~2,500 words (deepen the analysis of the AI Office's enforcement machinery, the interaction between the AI Act and DSA/DMA, and the open-source tension)
- China section: expand from ~1,030 to ~2,200 words (add more analysis of the CAC's enforcement culture, the role of provincial competition, the implications for developing nations)
- US section: expand from ~950 to ~2,200 words (deepen the SB 1047/SB 53 comparison, add analysis of NIST AI Safety Institute, discuss the FTC's enforcement role)
- Discussion/Conclusion: expand from ~950 to ~1,200 words

## 2. CRITICALITY 92 -- Structure

**Issue:** Paper includes a standalone Methodology section, which is absent from all three comparable IPR papers.

**Evidence:** Section 3 ("Methodology," lines 160--167, ~300 words) is a discrete numbered section. None of the three comparable papers has a separate methodology section. In all three, the analytical approach is described either within the introduction (Papers 1 and 3) or in an early theoretical-framing subsection (Paper 2).

**Norm:** The style analysis states explicitly: "There is no separate methodology section. Analytical approach is described within the introduction or in an early theoretical-framing section." This was consistent across all three papers.

**Fix:** Merge the methodology content into the Theoretical Framework section. Specifically, move lines 163--167 into Section 2 as a concluding paragraph or paragraphs. Rename the current Section 2 to something like "Theoretical Framework and Analytical Design" or keep it as "Theoretical Framework" and integrate the methodological discussion as its final ~300 words. This eliminates a section that signals unfamiliarity with IPR conventions and reclaims a section number (moving from 7 numbered sections to 6, closer to the 4--6 range in comparable papers).

---

## 3. CRITICALITY 85 -- Structure

**Issue:** Introduction lacks an explicit section-by-section roadmap.

**Evidence:** Our introduction (lines 137--143, four paragraphs, ~470 words) ends with a thematic overview of the three jurisdictions but never tells the reader what each section of the paper contains. There is no language like "Section 2 develops..." or "Section 3 examines..." anywhere in the introduction.

**Norm:** Paper 2 (Kira) includes a highly explicit roadmap: "Section 1 provides an overview... Section 2 introduces... Section 3 develops a comparative analysis..." Paper 3 (Roberts et al.) previews the argument in its compact introduction. Paper 1 (Crum) provides a roadmap in its third introductory paragraph. Two of three papers use explicit section-by-section signposting.

**Fix:** Add a roadmap paragraph at the end of the introduction (after the current paragraph 4, which ends at line 143). Suggested text:

"The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops a theoretical framework drawing on regulatory competition theory, a two-dimensional governance typology, and the innovation--safety tradeoff. Sections 3 through 5 apply this framework to the EU, China, and the United States in turn. Section 6 synthesises the comparison, assesses the Brussels Effect hypothesis against the evidence, and draws out implications for European internet governance and policy."

---

## 4. CRITICALITY 82 -- Stylometry

**Issue:** Paragraph length is far below the IPR norm -- mean of ~97 words versus the ~150-word norm.

**Evidence:** Our paper has 49 prose paragraphs with a mean length of ~97 words (SD ~33, range 12--167). The IPR norm is a mean of ~150 words (Crum ~180, Kira ~150, Roberts et al. ~130). Our maximum paragraph length (167 words) is below the mean of Paper 1. Additionally, 22.4% of our paragraphs (11 out of 49) are under 80 words -- many are single-idea statements that would be considered underdeveloped by IPR standards.

**Norm:** IPR paragraphs are "substantial and self-contained, often making a complete sub-argument" (style analysis of Crum). Mean paragraph length of 130--180 words across the three papers.

**Fix:** This issue is partly resolved by Critique #1 (expanding word count), but should be addressed deliberately. Combine short adjacent paragraphs that address the same sub-argument, and expand remaining paragraphs to develop their points more fully. Target a mean paragraph length of ~150 words with a minimum of ~80 words.

Specific merges recommended:
- In the EU section, the single-paragraph subsection 4.2 (lines 183, ~136 words) should be expanded or merged with subsection 4.1
- In the EU section, subsection 4.5 ("Implementation Progress," line 215, ~58 words in a single paragraph) is far too short for a subsection; merge it into subsection 4.4 or subsection 4.3
- In the China section, subsection 5.1 (lines 223, ~102 words single paragraph) is too thin; expand with analysis
- In the Discussion, the "European Policy" subsection (lines 390--398) consists of four paragraphs each beginning with "First," "Second," "Third," "Fourth" -- these are listlike and average ~78 words each; develop each into a fuller argumentative paragraph

## 5. CRITICALITY 78 -- Stylometry

**Issue:** Excessive reliance on "The" and "This/These/That" as sentence openers -- 36.3% versus the ~33% norm, with "The" alone at 23.9%.

**Evidence:** Of 201 sentences analysed, 73 (36.3%) begin with "The," "This," "These," "That," or "Those." Specifically: "The" opens 48 sentences (23.9%), "This" opens 19 (9.5%), "These" opens 6 (3.0%). The norm across the three papers is ~33% (Crum 30%, Kira 35%, Roberts et al. 33%).

While 36.3% is only slightly above the norm, the problem is compounded by two factors: (a) the very low use of subordinate clause openers (3.0% vs. the 15% norm), and (b) the very low use of transitional adverbs (4.0% vs. the 12% norm). The result is a monotonous sentence-opening pattern that reads as mechanical.

**Norm:** The three papers show a more balanced distribution: ~33% The/This, ~15% subordinate clauses, ~12% transitional adverbs, ~10-12% prepositional phrases.

**Fix:** Make targeted substitutions across the paper. Examples:

- Line 139: Change "A growing body of scholarship has examined these questions in isolation." to "Although a growing body of scholarship has examined these questions in isolation, few studies..."

- Line 149: Change "The scholarly literature on technology regulation documents a persistent pattern:" to "Across the scholarly literature on technology regulation, a persistent pattern emerges:"

- Line 177: Change "Negotiated across the European Commission, Parliament, and Council, the Act attracted intense lobbying..." -- this is already good (participial opener); keep it.

- Line 230: Change "Rather than the EU's horizontal risk classification, China has built AI governance through sector-specific regulations" to "Where the EU imposes a horizontal risk classification, China has built AI governance through sector-specific regulations"

- Line 267: Change "On paper, China imposes the heaviest compliance burden" to "Formally, China imposes the heaviest compliance burden" (varies from "On" pattern)

Target: reduce The/This to ~30%, increase subordinate clause openers to ~12%, increase transitional adverbs to ~10%.

---

## 6. CRITICALITY 75 -- Stylometry

**Issue:** Severe underuse of transitional adverbs between and within paragraphs.

**Evidence:** Only 8 sentences (4.0%) begin with transitional adverbs (However, Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally, Meanwhile, Yet, Crucially, Notably, etc.). The IPR norm is ~12% (Crum 12%, Kira 15%, Roberts et al. 12%). More strikingly, "However" appears only once in the entire paper (line 139). "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally," and "Notably" appear zero times each.

**Norm:** All three comparable papers use these connectors heavily: "However" is the most frequent counter-argument connector across all three; "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally" serve additive functions; "Notably" and "Importantly" signal emphasis. Paper 2 (Kira) relies particularly heavily on this signposting vocabulary.

**Fix:** Insert transitional adverbs at strategic points throughout the paper. Specific additions:

- Line 175, beginning of EU section: After the opening sentence about the governance typology, add a "Moreover" or "Notably" connection. Change "This approach reflects a broader European regulatory tradition" to "Moreover, this approach reflects a broader European regulatory tradition"

- Line 183 (Brussels Effect subsection): Change "Widely regarded as a strategic effort" to "Furthermore, the Act is widely regarded as a strategic effort"

- Line 223 (China hybrid model): After the first sentence, change "This combination challenges the binary framing" to "Notably, this combination challenges the binary framing"

- Line 292 (enforcement gap): Change "What matters analytically is the gap" to "However, what matters analytically is the gap"

- Line 308 (US section opener): After the first sentence, add "However" before the next observation about advantages and costs

- Line 346 (EO revocation paragraph): Change "The fragility of executive-branch governance became evident" to "However, the fragility of executive-branch governance became evident"

- Line 376 (Brussels Effect paragraph in Discussion): Change "Turning to the Brussels Effect hypothesis" to "Moreover, turning to the Brussels Effect hypothesis"

Target: at least 20 transitional adverb openers across the paper (~10% of sentences).

---

## 7. CRITICALITY 73 -- Structure

**Issue:** Three figures in a genre where zero is the norm.

**Evidence:** Our paper includes three figures: Figure 1 (EU AI Act decision tree, line 189--194), Figure 2 (risk pyramid, lines 198--203), and Figure 3 (SB 1047 timeline, lines 353--358). All three comparable IPR papers contain zero figures. Paper 2 uses tables (3 tables, 0 figures); Papers 1 and 3 use neither.

**Norm:** The style analysis is explicit: "Figures are not used in this genre of policy analysis." All three papers are entirely text-based or use tables to crystallise comparative findings.

**Fix:** Remove all three figures. Convert the essential content from each into prose:
- Figure 1 (decision tree): Describe the decision pathway for providers in a paragraph within subsection 4.3
- Figure 2 (risk pyramid): The four-tier hierarchy is already described in prose at line 196; the figure is redundant -- remove it entirely
- Figure 3 (SB 1047 timeline): Convert the timeline information into narrative prose within subsection 6.3

If one figure is judged essential for clarity, retain Figure 1 as a single exception, but be aware it departs from genre conventions.

---

## 8. CRITICALITY 72 -- Tone

**Issue:** Insufficient critical engagement with named scholars as interlocutors.

**Evidence:** Our paper uses \\citet (in-text author citations) only 5 times: Stix (line 139), Smuha (lines 139, 149), Bradford (line 151), and Rodrik (line 155). None of these citations involves sustained argumentative engagement -- all are brief attributions ("Author has shown...," "Author identified..."). There is no passage where we contest, extend, or critically evaluate a named scholar's position. The deepest engagement is the paragraph on Bradford's Brussels Effect (lines 151), which summarises the theory and identifies limits, but does so in the voice of detached description rather than intellectual dialogue.

**Norm:** Paper 1 (Crum) explicitly positions itself in critical dialogue with Bradford: "the belligerent framing of Bradford's Digital Empires" and "I build on the theory of experimentalist governance" -- the paper reads as "an argument with named scholars, not as a detached overview." Paper 3 (Roberts et al.) evaluates and critiques specific government positions with normative force. Paper 2 (Kira) draws on Abbott, Levi-Faur, and Snidal as a named theoretical framework.

**Fix:** Deepen engagement with at least three named scholars. Specific recommendations:

- In the Theoretical Framework (line 149--157), expand the Bradford discussion from summary to dialogue. Example addition after line 151: "Bradford's analysis, however, rests on conditions specific to data regulation: the non-rivalrous nature of personal data, the first-mover context of the GDPR, and the absence of competing frameworks. As Crum (2025) has argued in this journal, even within the digital domain the Brussels Effect thesis may overestimate European influence when experimentalist governance better describes the regulatory dynamic."

- Engage Smuha more substantively. Line 149 currently says "Author has shown that governments now compete to set the rules governing AI." Expand: "Smuha's (2021) concept of a 'race to regulate' captures the competitive dynamic well, but her framework does not distinguish between competition over regulatory substance and competition over institutional design -- a gap our typology addresses."

- Add engagement with Veale and Borgesius or Novelli on the AI Act's specific provisions, and with Roberts et al. (2023, Paper 3 in the style analysis) on the UK as a comparator case that our three-case design omits.

---

## 9. CRITICALITY 70 -- Stylometry

**Issue:** Excessive use of em-dashes, which are rare to absent in IPR papers.

**Evidence:** Our paper contains 22 em-dashes (---) in the body text. Examples:
- Line 151: "three conditions that enabled the GDPR's influence---the EU's first-mover advantage, the absence of credible competing models, and the relatively low cost of compliance---may not hold"
- Line 155: "tension between innovation and safety---a tradeoff that no jurisdiction has resolved"
- Line 196: "prohibited applications---including governmental social-credit scoring"
- Line 267: "fewer than 550 AI models had completed registration---a fraction of the half-million-plus"
- Line 292: "innovation-focused SMEs---dubbed 'Little Giants'---that enjoy"
- Line 308: "dozens of specialised federal agencies---the FTC, CPSC, CFPB, and many others---each guarding"
- Line 317: "same issues as the EU AI Act---safety, algorithmic bias, consumer protection"
- Line 364: "added its own accountability layer---annual third-party audits"

**Norm:** The style analysis is explicit: "Em-dashes: Rare to absent" (Paper 1); "Em-dashes: Virtually absent" (Paper 2); "Em-dashes: Used occasionally" (Paper 3). The norm across all three papers is near-zero em-dash usage. IPR papers use parentheses or commas for asides instead.

**Fix:** Replace all 22 em-dashes with parentheses, commas, or restructured sentences. Specific examples:

- Line 151: Change "three conditions that enabled the GDPR's influence---the EU's first-mover advantage, the absence of credible competing models, and the relatively low cost of compliance---may not hold" to "three conditions that enabled the GDPR's influence (the EU's first-mover advantage, the absence of credible competing models, and the relatively low cost of compliance) may not hold"

- Line 155: Change "tension between innovation and safety---a tradeoff that no jurisdiction has resolved" to "tension between innovation and safety, a tradeoff that no jurisdiction has resolved"

- Line 196: Change "prohibited applications---including governmental social-credit scoring" to "prohibited applications, including governmental social-credit scoring,"

- Line 292: Change "innovation-focused SMEs---dubbed 'Little Giants'---that enjoy" to "innovation-focused SMEs (dubbed 'Little Giants') that enjoy"

- Line 308: Change "dozens of specialised federal agencies---the FTC, CPSC, CFPB, and many others---each guarding" to "dozens of specialised federal agencies (the FTC, CPSC, CFPB, and many others), each guarding"

- Line 317: Change "same issues as the EU AI Act---safety, algorithmic bias, consumer protection" to "same issues as the EU AI Act (safety, algorithmic bias, consumer protection, privacy)"

Apply the same pattern to all remaining em-dashes.

---

## 10. CRITICALITY 68 -- Stylometry

**Issue:** Subordinate clause openers ("While...", "Given...", "Although...") are severely underused -- 3.0% versus the 15% norm.

**Evidence:** Only 6 of 201 sentences (3.0%) open with a subordinate clause. The IPR norm is ~15% (Crum 18%, Kira 15%, Roberts et al. 13%). This is the single largest departure from IPR stylometric norms by ratio (our rate is one-fifth the expected rate). Paper 3 notes that "Given" alone appears 8+ times as a sentence opener. Our paper uses "Given" as an opener zero times.

**Norm:** IPR papers use subordinate clause openers to introduce conditions, contrasts, and concessions: "While the EU pursues...," "Given that competing frameworks exist...," "Although registration requirements are strict on paper...."

**Fix:** Convert at least 20 sentences to subordinate clause openers. Specific conversions:

- Line 137: Add a subordinate opener to the second sentence: Change "Yet the Act does not operate in a regulatory vacuum." to "Although the Act represents a regulatory milestone, it does not operate in a vacuum."

- Line 149: Change "In the AI domain, Author has shown that governments now compete" to "Given the proliferation of national AI strategies, Author has shown that governments now compete"

- Line 163: Change "These cases were chosen because they account for the majority of global AI investment" to "Because these cases account for the majority of global AI investment"

- Line 179: Add to the internet governance paragraph: "While the EU layers AI governance onto the DSA and DMA, neither China nor the US has constructed a comparably integrated framework."

- Line 223: Change "This combination challenges the binary framing" to "Although this combination challenges the binary framing that dominates much comparative governance literature,"

- Line 310: Change "The speed of AI innovation, combined with limited technical expertise in Congress, has shifted initiative to the executive branch" to "Given the speed of AI innovation and limited technical expertise in Congress, initiative has shifted to the executive branch"

- Line 374: Change "These positions are not static, but institutional traditions exert a gravitational pull." to "While these positions are not static, institutional traditions exert a gravitational pull."

---

## 11. CRITICALITY 65 -- Tone

**Issue:** Hedging is insufficient for a comparative analysis paper -- the paper reads as more assertive than IPR norms allow.

**Evidence:** Our paper contains only 13 hedging instances across the entire body (9 uses of "may," 1 "could," 1 "appears," 1 "possible," 1 "unlikely"). By contrast, it contains 13 strong assertion words ("demonstrates," "confirms," "reveals," "shows," "establishes," "clearly"). The hedge-to-assertion ratio is approximately 1:1.

**Norm:** Paper 1 (Crum) consistently hedges: "it is far from sure that...," "may not only overestimate...," "one can question whether...." Paper 2 (Kira) uses "could potentially address...," "it seems plausible that...," "raise questions about...." Both Papers 1 and 2 hedge substantially more than they assert. Paper 3 is the most assertive of the three, but even it qualifies claims with "risks becoming" and "seems inadequate." The style analysis notes that for a comparative analysis paper (our genre), hedging should be more prominent.

**Fix:** Add hedging language to at least 10 currently unhedged assertions. Examples:

- Line 130 (abstract): Change "We show that the EU occupies" to "We argue that the EU occupies"

- Line 143: Change "these models are producing a multipolar regulatory order" to "these models appear to be producing a multipolar regulatory order"

- Line 175: Change "the EU AI Act exemplifies the centralised, ex ante quadrant" to "the EU AI Act most closely exemplifies the centralised, ex ante quadrant"

- Line 292: Change "This selective enforcement is not lawlessness but a strategic choice" to "This selective enforcement appears to reflect not lawlessness but a strategic choice"

- Line 344: Change "Enforcement reveals the contrast with the EU." to "Enforcement patterns highlight the contrast with the EU."

- Line 346: Change "The fragility of executive-branch governance became evident" to "The potential fragility of executive-branch governance became evident"

- Line 362: Change "The veto confirmed the gravitational pull" to "The veto suggested the gravitational pull"

- Line 372: Change "confirms the predicted positions" to "broadly confirms the predicted positions"

---

## 12. CRITICALITY 62 -- Tone

**Issue:** Over-reliance on the "governance typology" framing term, producing a formulaic quality.

**Evidence:** The phrase "governance typology" appears 11 times in the paper. The opening of every empirical section uses a nearly identical formula:
- Line 175 (EU): "In the governance typology, the EU AI Act exemplifies the centralised, ex ante quadrant."
- Line 223 (China): "China occupies the hybrid position in the governance typology:"
- Line 308 (US): "In the governance typology, the United States occupies the distributed, ex post quadrant."
- Line 372 (Discussion): "Mapping the three cases onto the governance typology from Section 2 confirms the predicted positions"

This repetitive framing produces a mechanical quality absent from the three comparable papers, none of which use a single framing phrase with this frequency.

**Norm:** Paper 1 (Crum) varies its framing vocabulary: "Brussels effect," "experimentalist governance," "the analysis establishes," "both perspectives suggest." Paper 2 (Kira) uses the RIT framework but references it with varied phrasing. The comparable papers avoid formulaic repetition of their core analytical terms.

**Fix:** Reduce "governance typology" to no more than 5 uses (currently 11). Vary the framing language:

- Line 175: Keep "In the governance typology" (first empirical use).
- Line 223: Change "occupies the hybrid position in the governance typology" to "occupies a hybrid position, combining centralised strategic direction with decentralised enforcement"
- Line 308: Change "In the governance typology, the United States occupies the distributed, ex post quadrant" to "The United States presents the starkest institutional contrast with the EU"
- Line 372: Change "Mapping the three cases onto the governance typology from Section 2" to "Mapping the three cases onto the analytical framework developed above"

Also vary the vocabulary when describing typological positions: "quadrant" appears 4 times; use alternatives like "position," "configuration," "institutional arrangement."

---

## 13. CRITICALITY 60 -- Vocabulary

**Issue:** Excessive use of Latin phrases, particularly "ex ante" (15 occurrences) and "ex post" (11 occurrences).

**Evidence:** The paper contains 39 Latin phrases: "ex ante" 15 times, "ex post" 11 times, "de facto" 9 times, "de jure" 4 times. While Latin phrases appear in IPR papers (Paper 1 uses "de jure," "de facto," "ex-ante"), they are used sparingly. Paper 1 uses "ex-ante" approximately 3--4 times; Papers 2 and 3 do not use Latin phrases prominently at all. Our usage of "ex ante" alone exceeds the total Latin usage of any comparable paper by a factor of 3--4.

**Norm:** The style analysis notes: "Latin phrases appear in Paper 1 (de jure, de facto, ex-ante) but not prominently in Papers 2 or 3." Latin is acceptable but should not dominate the vocabulary.

**Fix:** Reduce "ex ante" from 15 to ~5 uses, "ex post" from 11 to ~4, and "de facto" from 9 to ~4. Replace with English equivalents where the meaning is clear from context:

- Where "ex ante" appears in a passage that already establishes the concept, use "pre-market," "preventive," "before deployment," or "prospective."
- Where "ex post" is used redundantly, replace with "after-the-fact," "reactive," "harm-based," or "retrospective."
- Where "de facto" appears, replace some instances with "in practice," "effectively," or "operationally."

Keep the Latin terms in their first use (to define the concept), in the abstract, in the governance typology description, and in the comparative table. Replace elsewhere.

---

## 14. CRITICALITY 58 -- Tone

**Issue:** "First, Second, Third, Fourth" enumeration is overused, creating a list-like rather than argumentative structure.

**Evidence:** The paper contains 14 enumeration markers ("First," "Second," "Third," "Fourth"). These appear in:
- Theoretical Framework (lines 151, 153, 155): "First, we draw on... Second, we develop... Third, every AI regulatory framework must navigate..."
- Methodology (line 165): "(1) degree of centralisation, (2) regulatory modality..."
- Discussion/European Policy (lines 392, 394, 396, 398): "First, the EU's adaptive legislation approach... Second, the open-source tension... Third, the US experience... Fourth, growing geopolitical competition..."

The style analysis of comparable papers shows that none uses enumerated lists of policy implications. Paper 1's conclusion has three paragraphs making distinct points without enumeration. Paper 3's conclusion has specific recommendations but embeds them in discursive paragraphs.

**Norm:** IPR papers in this genre make their points through sustained argumentative paragraphs, not numbered lists. The "First... Second... Third..." pattern is associated with textbook exposition rather than scholarly argument.

**Fix:** In the Theoretical Framework (lines 151--157), keep the enumeration since it introduces three distinct theoretical perspectives -- this is structural. In the Discussion/European Policy subsection (lines 390--398), remove the enumeration and restructure as flowing paragraphs with topic sentences:

- Line 390: Remove "First," and let the paragraph stand on its topic sentence: "The EU's adaptive legislation approach, deliberately leaving technical details open, is both a strength and a vulnerability."
- Line 394: Change "Second, the open-source tension requires early attention." to "The open-source tension requires equally early attention."
- Line 396: Change "Third, the US experience exposes a structural advantage of legislation over executive action." to "A further implication concerns the structural advantage of legislation over executive action, exposed by the US experience."
- Line 398: Change "Fourth, growing geopolitical competition..." to "Finally, growing geopolitical competition..."

---

## 15. CRITICALITY 55 -- Structure

**Issue:** The EU, China, and US sections each have a different number of subsections and substantially different structures, producing an asymmetric architecture.

**Evidence:**
- EU section: 5 subsections (4.1 Centralised Ex Ante; 4.2 Brussels Effect; 4.3 Risk Classification; 4.4 Open Source; 4.5 Implementation)
- China section: 4 subsections (5.1 Hybrid Model; 5.2 Sector-Specific; 5.3 Enforcement Gap; 5.4 Recent Developments)
- US section: 3 subsections (6.1 Distributed; 6.2 EO 14110; 6.3 State-Level)

The EU section has nearly double the structural granularity of the US section. This creates an imbalance where the EU appears to be treated as the "main case" rather than one of three co-equal comparands.

**Norm:** Paper 2 (Kira), which is most similar to ours as a comparative paper, uses a symmetric structure: Section 3.1 analyses the EU DSA, Section 3.2 analyses the Brazilian Bill, with parallel subsection structures. Paper 3 (Roberts et al.) focuses on a single case but its subsections are thematically consistent.

**Fix:** Restructure to give each empirical section a parallel set of subsections. Suggested parallel structure:

For each jurisdiction (EU, China, US):
1. Governance model and institutional structure
2. Key regulatory instruments and enforcement
3. Open-source and innovation dynamics
4. Recent developments and trajectory

Alternatively, reduce the EU section to 3--4 subsections by merging 4.2 (Brussels Effect) into 4.1 and merging 4.5 (Implementation) into 4.3.

---

## 16. CRITICALITY 52 -- Stylometry

**Issue:** "However" appears only once in the entire paper.

**Evidence:** "However" appears once, at line 139. The word "Moreover" appears zero times; "Furthermore" zero times; "Additionally" zero times; "Notably" zero times. Across all three comparable papers, "However" is identified as "the most frequent counter-argument connector." Paper 2 (Kira) uses "However" approximately 8--10 times.

**Norm:** "However" and its counterparts are the primary mechanism for signalling counter-arguments, qualifications, and turns in the argument in IPR papers.

**Fix:** Add "However" at appropriate counter-argument junctures. Specific insertions recommended:

- Line 151: The sentence "For AI, however, three conditions..." already contains an embedded "however" -- restructure to front it: "However, three conditions that enabled the GDPR's influence..."
- Line 183 (Brussels Effect): After stating the Act's geopolitical ambition, add: "However, whether the AI Act can replicate the GDPR's dynamic is an open question"
- Line 211: Change "This matters for the innovation--safety tradeoff" to "However, this matters considerably for the innovation--safety tradeoff"
- Line 294 (China enforcement): Change the paragraph starting "When destabilising patterns emerge" to "However, when destabilising patterns emerge, enforcement can turn punitive."
- Line 310: "This distributed structure has both advantages and costs." to "However, this distributed structure carries both advantages and costs."

Target: at least 6--8 uses of "However" across the paper.

---

## 17. CRITICALITY 48 -- Tone

**Issue:** The paper lacks the authorial voice and intellectual personality evident in published IPR papers.

**Evidence:** Our paper adopts a neutral-descriptive voice throughout. There are no passages where the authors contest a specific scholar's position, express a distinctive judgment with stylistic force, or use language with literary flair. The closest we come is the phrase "multipolar regulatory landscape" and the characterisation of China's enforcement as "permissive by default, punitive when threatened" (line 294). By contrast:

- Paper 1 (Crum) describes Bradford's work as having a "belligerent framing" and uses the word "lodestar"
- Paper 3 (Roberts et al.) states that "industry self-regulation demonstrably failed" and uses "ethics washing"
- Paper 1 engages with named scholars as "intellectual interlocutors" with "subtle critical edge"

**Norm:** IPR papers in this genre are expected to have a recognisable authorial voice. The style analysis notes: "None [of the three papers] is purely descriptive. The critical analysis is grounded in evidence rather than opinion."

**Fix:** Inject critical voice at key analytical moments. Examples:

- In the Bradford discussion (line 151), add a sharper assessment: After listing the three conditions, add: "To assume that the Brussels Effect will mechanically replicate in AI governance is to mistake a contingent outcome for a structural law."

- In the China enforcement gap discussion (line 292), strengthen the analytical voice: Change "This selective enforcement is not lawlessness but a strategic choice" to "Characterising this pattern as mere regulatory failure, as Western commentary often does, misreads its strategic logic."

- In the Discussion (line 376), after noting the mixed evidence for the Brussels Effect: "The result is not convergence but regulatory pluralism -- a finding that should temper the self-congratulatory framing that has accompanied the AI Act's passage." (Echoing Crum's "self-congratulatory fashion" register.)

## 18. CRITICALITY 45 -- Formatting

**Issue:** Paper uses 7 numbered body sections (Introduction through Discussion), exceeding the typical 4--6 range.

**Evidence:** Our numbered sections are: (1) Introduction, (2) Theoretical Framework, (3) Methodology, (4) The European Union, (5) China, (6) United States, (7) Discussion and Conclusion. The three comparable papers have 4, 5, and 6 main sections respectively. Our count of 7 is at the upper boundary.

**Norm:** IPR papers use 4--6 main body sections.

**Fix:** Merge the Methodology section into the Theoretical Framework (see Critique #2), reducing the section count to 6. This brings the paper squarely within the IPR range.

---

## 19. CRITICALITY 42 -- Vocabulary

**Issue:** "Brussels Effect" appears 14 times -- repetitive for a paper of this length.

**Evidence:** "Brussels Effect" appears 14 times across ~5,400 words (once per ~386 words). In a paper expanded to ~10,000 words, this frequency would be less problematic, but even then 14 uses would be high. Paper 1 (Crum), which is centrally about the Brussels Effect, uses the term approximately 8--10 times across ~9,500 words.

**Norm:** Key theoretical terms should be introduced, defined, and then used with decreasing frequency, supplemented by pronouns ("this dynamic," "such regulatory projection") and varied paraphrases ("Europe's regulatory influence," "the extraterritorial pull of EU standards").

**Fix:** Reduce to ~8 uses by replacing redundant instances with paraphrases:
- "regulatory projection"
- "Europe's standard-setting influence"
- "the extraterritorial pull of EU regulation"
- "this dynamic" or "this mechanism" (after an antecedent use)

---

## 20. CRITICALITY 40 -- Stylometry

**Issue:** Passive voice usage (~11.4%) is well below the IPR norm (~25-32%).

**Evidence:** Rough measurement shows ~11.4% of sentences use passive constructions. The IPR norm is 25--32% (Crum ~27%, Kira ~32%, Roberts et al. ~25%). Our paper is more active-voice-dominant than any comparable paper.

**Norm:** IPR papers use passive voice extensively for describing what legislation does ("has been adopted," "were written," "is to be maintained"), what regulatory bodies enact ("responsibilities are assigned"), and what scholarly consensus holds ("it has been argued"). Active voice dominates only for the authors' own analytical contributions.

**Fix:** Convert some sentences describing legislative/regulatory actions to passive voice. Examples:

- Line 137: "the EU AI Act's provisions banning prohibited AI practices became legally binding" -- keep active (event narrative)
- Line 177: Change "the Act attracted intense lobbying from national governments" to "intense lobbying was directed at the Act by national governments"
- Line 183: Change "The GDPR demonstrated both mechanisms of the Brussels Effect" to "Both mechanisms of the Brussels Effect were demonstrated by the GDPR" (or better: "Both mechanisms of the Brussels Effect have been demonstrated in the GDPR context")
- Line 230: Change "China has built AI governance through sector-specific regulations" to "AI governance in China has been built through sector-specific regulations"
- Line 346: Change "the incoming Trump administration rescinded EO #14110" to "EO #14110 was rescinded by the incoming Trump administration"

Target: ~20-25% passive voice, particularly in passages describing institutional actions.

---

## 21. CRITICALITY 38 -- Structure

**Issue:** No block quotes from primary sources, despite the genre norm of grounding arguments in specific documentary language.

**Evidence:** Our paper contains zero block quotes. The only direct quotation is the inline quote from MEP Dragos Tudorache at line 175 ("an opportunity to express our values") and the AI Office mandate ("convergence toward common approaches," line 183). Neither is set as a block quote.

**Norm:** Paper 1 (Crum) opens the introduction with a block quote from the Council of the EU. Paper 2 (Kira) includes multiple block quotes from legislation. Paper 3 (Roberts et al.) uses direct quotation from government documents in the abstract itself. The style analysis notes that block quotes from primary sources "ground the theoretical argument in specific language."

**Fix:** Add 1--2 block quotes from primary sources, particularly from:
- The AI Act's recitals or articles (e.g., the definition of "high-risk" or the extraterritorial jurisdiction provision)
- China's Generative AI Measures (e.g., the requirement for "socialist core values" compliance)
- The Trump administration's EO 14179 (e.g., the language on "removing barriers to American AI innovation")

These would ground the analysis in the actual regulatory language and increase the paper's connection to primary-source evidence.

---

## 22. CRITICALITY 35 -- Tone

**Issue:** Abstract uses "We show" (line 130), which is more assertive than the tentative framing used in comparable IPR abstracts.

**Evidence:** Our abstract states: "We show that the EU occupies the centralised, ex ante quadrant." Paper 1 (Crum) uses "This paper juxtaposes..." and "the analysis establishes that..." -- more tentative. Paper 2 (Kira) uses "This article seeks to contribute..." Paper 3 (Roberts et al.) frames as evaluation rather than proof.

**Norm:** IPR abstracts use tentative or process-oriented framing: "juxtaposes," "seeks to contribute," "examines," "argues." They avoid the empiricist "we show" framing, which implies definitive proof.

**Fix:** Change "We show that the EU occupies" (line 130) to "We argue that the EU occupies" or "The analysis suggests that the EU occupies." The latter is closest to Paper 1's "the analysis establishes that..." formulation.

---

## 23. CRITICALITY 32 -- Formatting

**Issue:** Subsection headings use colons, which may appear inconsistent with the flat heading style of comparable papers.

**Evidence:** Four of our headings contain colons:
- "The Hybrid Model: Centralised Guidance, Decentralised Enforcement" (line 221)
- "The Enforcement Gap: De Jure Strictness, De Facto Permissiveness" (line 262)
- "State-Level AI Regulation: SB 1047, SB 53, and the RAISE Act" (line 348)
- "Appendix A: Comparative Regulatory Provisions" (line 430)

**Norm:** Paper 1 (Crum) uses descriptive but colon-free headings: "How AI is not just another digital technology," "Deciphering the EU AI Act." Paper 2 uses numbered section labels. Paper 3 uses plain descriptive headings. Colons in headings are uncommon across all three.

**Fix:** Remove colons from subsection headings:
- "The Hybrid Model: Centralised Guidance, Decentralised Enforcement" -> "China's Hybrid Governance Model"
- "The Enforcement Gap: De Jure Strictness, De Facto Permissiveness" -> "The Gap Between Formal Rules and Enforcement Practice"
- "State-Level AI Regulation: SB 1047, SB 53, and the RAISE Act" -> "State-Level AI Regulation in California and New York"
- Keep the Appendix colon (standard convention for appendix titles)

---

## 24. CRITICALITY 30 -- Vocabulary

**Issue:** "governance typology" and "risk classification" appear with high frequency, contributing to vocabulary repetition.

**Evidence:** "governance typology" appears 11 times, "risk classification" appears 10 times, "internet governance" appears 10 times. These three phrases account for a disproportionate share of the paper's analytical vocabulary, producing a narrow lexical range.

**Norm:** Comparable papers vary their vocabulary for core concepts. Paper 1 alternates between "Brussels effect," "regulatory impact," "global standard-setting," "regulatory projection," and "legislative influence." Paper 3 uses "governance approach," "regulatory framework," "regulatory strategy," and "policy model" interchangeably.

**Fix:** Introduce synonyms and near-synonyms for repeated terms:
- "governance typology" -> "analytical framework," "classificatory scheme," "two-dimensional mapping"
- "risk classification" -> "risk-based categorisation," "tiered regulatory scheme," "pre-market sorting mechanism"
- "internet governance" -> "online regulation," "digital governance," "platform regulation"

---

## 25. CRITICALITY 28 -- Stylometry

**Issue:** Mean sentence length (23.8 words) is at the lower end of the IPR range, and the proportion of short sentences is higher than the norm.

**Evidence:** Our mean sentence length is 23.8 words (SD 10.8). The IPR norm is 24--28 words (Crum 28, Kira 25, Roberts et al. 24). While 23.8 is within the low end of the range, 22.9% of our sentences are under 15 words, compared to the norm of 8--12% (Crum 8%, Kira 10%, Roberts et al. 12%). This excess of short sentences contributes to a staccato rhythm unlike the sustained, multi-clause sentences typical of IPR prose.

**Norm:** IPR papers favour "complex, multi-clause sentences with embedded qualifications" (style analysis of Crum). 10--18% of sentences should exceed 40 words; our paper has only 5.5% in this range.

**Fix:** Combine short adjacent sentences into longer, multi-clause constructions. Examples:

- Lines 130 (abstract): "The US sits in the distributed, ex post corner. China pursues a hybrid combining top-down guidance with selective, sector-specific enforcement." -> "The US sits in the distributed, ex post corner, while China pursues a hybrid combining top-down guidance with selective, sector-specific enforcement."

- Line 141: "In the US, the absence of a federal equivalent to the DSA means that AI-driven content decisions remain largely self-regulated. How jurisdictions regulate AI therefore shapes platform accountability" -> "Because the US lacks a federal equivalent to the DSA, AI-driven content decisions remain largely self-regulated, and how jurisdictions regulate AI therefore shapes platform accountability"

- Line 143: "The EU pursues centralised, ex ante risk classification. The US distributes responsibilities across existing agencies with ex post enforcement. China combines top-down guidance with decentralised, sector-specific implementation." -> Combine into one sentence with semicolons or "while" connectors.

Target: reduce under-15-word sentences from 22.9% to ~12%, and increase over-40-word sentences from 5.5% to ~12%.

## 26. CRITICALITY 25 -- Formatting

**Issue:** The "Teaser" field is included in the document, which may not be standard in published IPR papers.

**Evidence:** Line 120 includes a "Teaser" field. While IPR does use teasers in its online format, none of the three analysed papers includes a teaser as part of the submitted manuscript. The teaser is typically added during production.

**Norm:** The three analysed papers' structure begins with Abstract, not a Teaser. It is possible that IPR requests teasers separately; including one in the manuscript body is unusual.

**Fix:** Verify IPR's submission guidelines. If the teaser is requested as a separate field in the submission system, remove it from the manuscript body. If IPR asks for it in the manuscript, keep it but ensure it matches the abstract's framing.

---

## 27. CRITICALITY 22 -- Tone

**Issue:** "We" is used 11 times (6 capitalised, 5 lowercase) plus "Our" 4 times -- a total of 15 first-person plural instances.

**Evidence:** Fifteen first-person plural instances across ~5,400 words (one per ~360 words). Paper 3 (Roberts et al.), a six-author paper, uses "we" approximately 5--6 times across ~12,500 words (one per ~2,100 words). Paper 2 (Kira) does not use first person at all. Paper 1 (Crum) uses "I" 5--6 times across ~9,500 words.

**Norm:** First person is acceptable but should be used sparingly -- approximately 5--6 instances across a full-length paper. The frequency should be roughly one first-person instance per 2,000 words.

**Fix:** Reduce from 15 to ~6 uses by converting some "We" constructions to third-person or passive voice:
- "We show" -> "The analysis shows"
- "We develop" -> "The paper develops" or rephrase
- "Our analysis" -> "The analysis" (when not the first use)
- "Our primary method" -> "The primary method"
- "Our methodological contribution" -> "The methodological contribution"

Retain "We" for 4--6 key assertions where authorial agency is important (e.g., "We argue," "We conclude").

---

## 28. CRITICALITY 18 -- Formatting

**Issue:** The paper includes a separate "Author Contributions" section and detailed author biographies, which are present in published IPR papers but may differ in their placement.

**Evidence:** Lines 401--416 contain "Author Contributions" and "About the Authors" as unnumbered sections. Paper 3 (Roberts et al.) does not have visible author contributions. Papers 1 and 2 have acknowledgements sections but not detailed biographies in the body text.

**Norm:** IPR adds author biographies during production. Check whether the submission system handles these separately.

**Fix:** Verify IPR's submission guidelines for author biography placement. If biographies are submitted through the system rather than in the manuscript, remove lines 409--416 from the manuscript body. Keep the Author Contributions section as it appears standard for multi-author papers.

---

## 29. CRITICALITY 15 -- Formatting

**Issue:** The title uses a colon to separate main title from subtitle, which is acceptable but worth verifying against IPR conventions.

**Evidence:** Our title: "The EU AI Act in Global Context: Comparing European, Chinese, and American AI Governance." Paper 1 uses "or" ("Brussels effect or experimentalism?"). Paper 2 uses "in" ("Regulatory intermediaries in content moderation"). Paper 3 uses a colon ("Artificial intelligence regulation in the United Kingdom: a path to good governance and global leadership?").

**Norm:** Both colon and non-colon titles appear in IPR papers. Papers 1 and 3 use question marks to signal analytical inquiry. Our title is declarative.

**Fix:** Consider adding a question element to signal analytical rather than descriptive intent: "The EU AI Act in Global Context: Can the Brussels Effect Survive Multipolar AI Governance?" or "Comparing EU, Chinese, and American AI Governance: Toward a Multipolar Regulatory Landscape?"

---

## 30. CRITICALITY 12 -- Grammar

**Issue:** Inconsistent hyphenation of "ex ante" and "ex post" -- sometimes used as adjectives without hyphens.

**Evidence:** The paper uses "ex ante" and "ex post" both as adjectives modifying nouns ("ex ante regulation," "ex post enforcement") and as standalone adverbs. Paper 1 (Crum) consistently hyphenates "ex-ante" when used adjectivally. Our paper never hyphenates.

**Norm:** Paper 1 uses "ex-ante" (hyphenated); Papers 2 and 3 do not use these terms prominently. Academic style guides vary, but consistency within the paper is essential.

**Fix:** Choose one convention and apply consistently. Since IPR does not enforce a specific style, keep unhyphenated "ex ante" and "ex post" throughout (the more common convention in political science), but verify against IPR's own published style guide or copy-editing practice. Ensure all 26 instances (15 ex ante + 11 ex post) follow the same convention.
