# Humanizing Heuristics for Academic Writing

## A. Syntax-Level Patterns

### A1. Em Dash Overuse
AI uses em dashes at 3--5x the human rate, mimicking punchy sales copy. Replace most with commas, semicolons, colons, or parentheses. Retain em dashes only for genuine dramatic interruptions. Target: max 1--2 per 1,000 words.

### A2. Colon-Heavy Constructions
AI frequently structures sentences as "X: Y" to introduce explanations. Vary with subordinate clauses, relative clauses, or separate sentences.

### A3. Semicolon Triplets
AI loves semicolon-separated lists of three: "X does A; Y does B; and Z does C." Vary the groupings, merge items, or restructure into flowing prose.

## B. Vocabulary-Level Patterns

### B1. Abstract "Landscape" Metaphor
"regulatory landscape," "threat landscape," "policy landscape" are overused. Replace with "environment," "domain," "field," "terrain," "arena," or restructure to avoid the metaphor entirely.

### B2. "Ecosystem" as Generic Container
AI uses "ecosystem" for any collection of related things. Substitute more precise terms: "apparatus," "network," "regime," or name the specific components.

### B3. Copula Avoidance
AI substitutes "serves as," "stands as," "functions as," "is positioned as" for simple "is" or "are." Prefer the simpler copula unless the longer form adds genuine meaning.

### B4. Significance Inflation
"defining challenge," "inseparable from," "deeply embedded," "indispensable to," "unprecedented" -- AI inflates importance. Use neutral, precise language and let evidence carry the weight.

### B5. "Directly" and Intensifier Scattering
AI scatters "directly," "particularly," "increasingly," "dramatically." Remove most; the sentence is usually stronger without them.

### B6. High-Frequency AI Vocabulary Clusters
Watch for co-occurrence of: additionally, crucial, pivotal, underscore, highlight, foster, showcase, intricate, tapestry, enduring, testament, vibrant, interplay, delve, landscape, enhance, garner, key (adj.), valuable, unprecedented, consequential. Any two in the same sentence is a red flag.

## C. Structural Patterns

### C1. Rule of Three
AI forces items into groups of three even when the content does not require it. Vary: use pairs, groups of four, or a single item with elaboration. The trilemma itself (three vertices) is substantive and should remain, but surrounding prose need not echo the pattern.

### C2. Negative Parallelisms
"Not merely X -- it is Y" and "Not only X but also Y" are AI hallmarks when overused. Rewrite as direct assertions ("X is Y") or vary the construction ("Beyond X, Y applies").

### C3. Formulaic Transitions
"Several patterns emerge," "A clear pattern emerges," "This carries implications for" -- these are stock LLM transitions. Replace with transitions that reference specific content or simply state the next point.

### C4. Uniform Sentence Length
AI produces paragraphs where every sentence is roughly 25--40 words. Insert short sentences (5--15 words) and long ones (40--60 words) to create natural rhythm.

### C5. Mirror-Structure Comparisons
When comparing entities (EU, US, China), AI uses identical sentence structures for each. Vary the syntax: lead with different elements, merge two into one sentence, or change the order of clauses.

### C6. Throat-Clearing Openings
Sentences that announce what the section will do ("This section examines...") before doing it. Prefer direct statements that begin the analysis.

## D. Rhetorical and Style Patterns

### D1. Generic Conclusions
"The trilemma will only sharpen" / "for decades to come" -- vague forward-looking closings. End on a concrete point or an unresolved tension rather than a tidy wrap-up.

### D2. Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)
Cycling through near-synonyms for the same concept across successive sentences: "framework" -> "architecture" -> "apparatus" -> "ecosystem." Pick one term per context and reuse it, or vary only where a genuine distinction exists.

### D3. Superficial -ing Analyses
Tacking present-participle phrases onto sentences to simulate depth: "highlighting the tension," "underscoring the challenge," "reflecting broader trends." Delete or rewrite as independent clauses.

### D4. Promotional and Inflated Phrasing
"the world's first," "the most comprehensive," "perhaps the most onerous" -- AI inflates claims for rhetorical impact. Qualify or remove superlatives unless they are verifiable.

### D5. False Specificity
"over 130 countries" / "over fifty agencies" -- AI rounds to impressive-sounding numbers. Use "more than" or verify and give exact counts.

### D6. Sycophantic or Hedging Filler
"It is important to note that," "It should be noted," "It is worth emphasising" -- AI hedging adds nothing. Delete the throat-clearing and state the point.

## E. Application Rules

1. **Preserve facts, statistics, citations, and core arguments.** Change only phrasing, syntax, and word choice.
2. **Maintain academic register.** The goal is natural scholarly prose, not casual blog writing.
3. **Concentrate changes where patterns cluster.** A single em dash or one "landscape" is fine; three in one paragraph signals AI.
4. **Vary the fixes.** Do not replace every em dash with a comma. Use commas, semicolons, parentheses, and restructured sentences.
5. **Read the result aloud.** If it sounds like a Wikipedia article or a consultant's slide deck, it still needs work.
