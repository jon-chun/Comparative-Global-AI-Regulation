# arXiv Preprint Disclosure — Internet Policy Review Submission

**For inclusion in the IPR submission portal or cover letter.**

---

An earlier version of this paper was posted as an arXiv preprint in October 2024 (arXiv:2410.21279, "Comparative Global AI Regulation: Policy Perspectives from the EU, China, and the US"). The preprint is a descriptive survey without the theoretical framework, governance typology, methodology section, 2025 regulatory updates, or European policy implications developed in the present submission. The current paper represents a substantial revision: approximately 40% of the content is new, the analytical framing has been entirely reworked, and the paper has been reformatted for Internet Policy Review's requirements. We understand that IPR permits submission of papers that have appeared as preprints on arXiv or similar repositories.
