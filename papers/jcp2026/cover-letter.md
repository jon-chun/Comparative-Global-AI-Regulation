Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, "The Cyber Governance Trilemma: Comparative AI Regulation in the EU, China, and the United States," for consideration by the *Journal of Cyber Policy*. We believe the paper aligns closely with JCP's mission and may be of particular interest in the context of the journal's 10-year anniversary reflections on the evolution of cyber policy.

**Summary.** The paper presents a systematic comparative analysis of AI regulatory frameworks in the EU, China, and the United States, updated through late 2025. Its central argument is that AI regulation is now a defining cyber governance challenge: the three major jurisdictions face a *cyber governance trilemma* in which no jurisdiction can simultaneously optimise innovation speed, safety and rights protection, and regulatory interoperability. We formally argue the mechanism driving this trilemma through three bilateral tensions and draw out implications for international cyber governance, including for transatlantic coordination, developing-nation model adoption, and AI-enabled cyber conflict.

**Original contributions.** The paper makes three contributions to the JCP readership. First, it provides a comparative regulatory timeline---a structured dataset of 22 milestones across the three jurisdictions from 2016 to 2026---with explicit inclusion criteria and analytical observations on acceleration, sequencing, and competitive dynamics. Second, it introduces and formally argues the cyber governance trilemma as a theoretical proposition grounded in regime complexity theory (Nye), comparative regulatory capitalism (Majone, Levi-Faur), and the Brussels Effect literature (Bradford). Third, it extends the analysis to developing nations (Brazil, India, Singapore, the African Union, and ASEAN), military AI governance, and international norm-building processes---connecting AI regulation to the broader cyber governance agenda that JCP readers engage with daily.

**Disclosure of related work.** In the interest of full transparency, we wish to disclose two related works:

1. **arXiv preprint.** An earlier version of the underlying comparative analysis was posted as an arXiv preprint in October 2024 (arXiv:2410.21279). That paper is a descriptive survey of AI regulation without theoretical framing, cyber governance analysis, or the trilemma thesis. Taylor & Francis policy explicitly permits prior arXiv posting.

2. **Internet Policy Review submission.** A companion paper, "Comparative Global AI Regulation: Policy Perspectives from the EU, China, and the US," has been prepared for submission to *Internet Policy Review*. The IPR paper targets a different audience (internet policy scholars and EU policymakers), employs a different theoretical framework (three lenses, without regime complexity or cyber sovereignty), and draws different conclusions (European policy implications rather than international cyber governance). The two papers share empirical subject matter---the same three jurisdictions and regulatory developments---but make distinct analytical arguments to distinct audiences. We estimate textual overlap at approximately 15--20%, confined to factual descriptions of regulatory instruments. The analytical framing, theoretical apparatus, original contributions, discussion, and conclusions are entirely different.

Both journals operate on rolling review timelines. We intend to submit the IPR paper concurrently. Neither journal's policies prohibit simultaneous submission of different papers to different journals, and the distinct framing ensures that each paper makes an independent contribution appropriate to its target audience.

We confirm that this manuscript has not been published in its current form and is not under consideration at any other journal. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree to its submission to the *Journal of Cyber Policy*.

We look forward to the opportunity to contribute to JCP's important work in advancing cyber policy scholarship.

Sincerely,
