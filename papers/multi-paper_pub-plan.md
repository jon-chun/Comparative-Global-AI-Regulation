## 1. Paper Portfolio

Three papers derive from the same underlying research programme --- a comparative analysis of AI regulatory frameworks in the EU, China, and the United States --- but each targets a different audience, employs a different analytical framework, and makes a different original contribution. Both submission-ready papers have undergone three passes of humanizing edits (131 total changes) to remove AI writing patterns.

## 3. Self-Plagiarism Assessment

### 3.1 Estimated Textual Overlap

| Paper Pair | Overlap | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| arXiv vs IPR | ~60--65% | IPR is a substantial revision of arXiv. T&F and IPR both permit arXiv preprints. Acceptable: the preprint is a draft version, not a separate publication. |
| arXiv vs JCP | ~25--30% | JCP is a thorough reframing. Shared empirical base but different thesis, framework, and conclusions. Acceptable. |
| **IPR vs JCP** | **~15--20%** | **Most relevant comparison.** After all revisions, overlap is confined to factual descriptions of regulatory instruments. Analytical framing, theoretical apparatus, original contributions, discussion, and conclusions are entirely different. |

### 3.2 Verdict

**Both the IPR and JCP papers can be submitted independently without self-plagiarism.**

The academic standard for publishing from the same research programme across multiple venues requires that each paper makes a distinct analytical contribution to a distinct audience. This criterion is met:

1. **Different theses.** IPR argues for a multipolar regulatory landscape with European policy implications. JCP argues for a cyber governance trilemma with international security implications.
2. **Different theoretical apparatus.** JCP adds regime complexity, cyber sovereignty, and comparative regulatory capitalism grounding --- none present in IPR. The IPR paper has no cyber governance analysis.
3. **Different original contributions.** JCP contributes the trilemma concept, the regulatory timeline dataset, developing-nations cascade analysis, and the AI-cyber conflict subsection. IPR contributes the governance typology application and EU implementation analysis.
4. **Different audiences.** Internet policy scholars (IPR) vs cyber governance practitioners and security analysts (JCP). Minimal readership overlap.
5. **Different conclusions.** European policy recommendations (IPR) vs international cyber governance implications (JCP).
6. **Below overlap threshold.** At ~15--20%, textual overlap is below the informal ~25% threshold at which editors flag concern.

**Recommended disclosure:** Both the arXiv preprint and the IPR companion paper should be disclosed in the JCP cover letter (drafted at `papers/jcp2026/cover-letter.md`). The IPR submission need not disclose the JCP paper, but should note the arXiv preprint.

---

## 4. Submission Timeline

Both JCP and IPR operate on **rolling review** --- neither has fixed submission deadlines. This simplifies timing: the papers can be submitted concurrently.

### 4.1 Recommended Sequence

| Week | Action | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Week 0** (now) | Send inquiry to JCP | Email Joyce Hakmeh (commissioning editor) with paper summary. Gauge editorial appetite before formal submission. Draft at `papers/jcp2026/email-hakmeh.md`. |
| **Week 0** | Submit IPR paper | IPR paper (`papers/ipr2026/`) is ready. Submit via ScholarOne or IPR's submission portal. Include note disclosing arXiv preprint. |
| **Week 1--2** | Await JCP editorial signal | If positive: proceed to full submission. If negative: pivot to alternative venues (see Section 5). |
| **Week 2--3** | Submit JCP paper | Submit full manuscript with cover letter disclosing arXiv preprint and IPR companion paper. |
| **Weeks 4--12** | Peer review (both journals) | JCP: review model not disclosed; expect 8--12 weeks. IPR: expect 6--10 weeks. |
| **Weeks 12--16** | Revise and resubmit | Address reviewer comments. The distinct framing of each paper means R&R requests will be independent. |
| **Weeks 16--24** | Acceptance/publication | Both journals have relatively fast post-acceptance production. |

### 4.2 Timing Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IPR published before JCP review** | 30% | JCP reviewers see published IPR paper and flag overlap | Cover letter proactively discloses IPR; overlap at ~15--20% is below concern threshold |
| **JCP editor rejects on fit** | 15% | No JCP submission | Inquiry email (Week 0) tests fit before formal submission; pivot venues available |
| **Reviewer at both journals** | 5% | Same person reviews both papers | Extremely unlikely given different disciplines; distinct framing makes independent evaluation straightforward |
| **Both rejected** | 10% | Need alternative venues | Fallback venues identified (Section 5) |

### 4.3 Concurrent Submission Ethics

Neither JCP nor IPR prohibits concurrent submission of **different** papers to **different** journals. The ethical constraint is against submitting the **same** paper to multiple venues simultaneously. Since the two papers make distinct contributions (verified in Section 3), concurrent submission is permissible and disclosed in the JCP cover letter.

## 5. Fallback Venues

If either paper is rejected, alternative venues are ranked by fit:

### For the JCP paper (cyber governance framing)

| Journal | Fit | IF | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| *International Affairs* (Chatham House) | Strong | 5.0 | Higher prestige; same publisher; same citation style |
| *Regulation & Governance* (Wiley) | Strong | 4.4 | Comparative regulation focus |
| *Computer Law & Security Review* (Elsevier) | Good | 3.2 | Published Veale & Borgesius on AI Act |
| *Policy & Internet* (Wiley) | Good | 4.1 | Technology policy focus |

### For the IPR paper (internet policy framing)

| Journal | Fit | IF | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| *Policy & Internet* (Wiley) | Strong | 4.1 | Closest alternative to IPR |
| *Telecommunications Policy* (Elsevier) | Good | 5.6 | Broader but strong digital policy coverage |
| *Government Information Quarterly* (Elsevier) | Good | 7.4 | Higher IF; digital government focus |

## 7. Acceptance Probability Assessment

### 7.1 IPR Paper: Estimated Acceptance Probability

**Current estimate: 60--65%**

#### Strengths

- Fills a gap: no recent systematic 3-way comparison in IPR (EU, China, US with unified analytical framework)
- Updated through late 2025 (Trump revocation, EU enforcement milestones, SB 53, RAISE Act)
- Clear governance typology gives the paper analytical structure beyond mere description
- Word count (7,503) is well within IPR's typical range
- APA 7th citation style is correct for IPR
- Three passes of humanizing edits (56 changes) reduce AI writing signatures
- IPR publishes open-access policy research and accepts arXiv preprints

#### Outstanding Critiques

| # | Critique | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| IPR-C1 | **Author bios are one-line stubs.** IPR requires substantive bios. Current text ("His research focuses on AI policy and regulation") is a placeholder, not a bio. Compare with JCP bios (4--5 sentences each with credentials). | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-8** | Copy and adapt the substantive bios already written for JCP (`jcp2026_cyber-governance-trilemma.tex` lines 411--415). Adjust phrasing to avoid verbatim overlap. 15 minutes. |
| IPR-C2 | **"NOTE TO AUTHORS" comments still in source.** Lines 130, 153--154, 168, 474--475 contain placeholder comments ("Revised to foreground the analytical contribution", "Adapt this to accurately reflect your actual research process"). These will not appear in the PDF but signal an incomplete revision to anyone reviewing the .tex source or DOCX conversion. | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-3** | Delete the 4 comment blocks. 5 minutes. |
| IPR-C3 | **Methodology section reads as template.** The methodology (Section 3) is competent but generic. It does not name the specific secondary sources consulted, does not explain why late-2024 was chosen as the cutoff, and does not acknowledge limitations (no primary data, no interviews). IPR reviewers in political science will expect reflexivity about method limitations. | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-5** | Add 2--3 sentences acknowledging: (a) the study relies on secondary sources without interviews or surveys; (b) the rapidly evolving policy landscape means findings are current through late 2025 but may shift; (c) the three-case design sacrifices depth for breadth. |
| IPR-C4 | **No explicit connection to internet governance / platform regulation.** IPR's core audience cares about internet governance, platform regulation, and digital rights. The paper frames its contribution as "AI regulation" and "European policy" but never connects to IPR's specific editorial interests (e.g., how AI regulation interacts with content moderation, platform accountability, or digital rights frameworks). | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-7** | Add 2--3 sentences in the Introduction or Discussion connecting AI regulation to internet governance debates (e.g., the AI Act's interaction with the Digital Services Act, platform accountability for AI-generated content, algorithmic transparency as an internet governance issue). |
| IPR-C5 | **Appendix A (SB 1047 supporters/opponents) is tangential.** This table is inherited from the arXiv preprint. It lists supporters and opponents of a vetoed California bill with URL links --- useful as a reference but not analytical. It is also the highest-overlap element with the JCP paper (~99% identical before JCP removed it). | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-4** | Remove Appendix A or replace it with something that serves the analytical argument (e.g., a comparative table of regulatory provisions across all three jurisdictions). |
| IPR-C6 | **No original data or empirical contribution.** The paper is a pure secondary-source synthesis. IPR publishes such work but gives priority to papers with original empirical contributions (datasets, interviews, computational analysis). The absence of primary data is a competitive disadvantage against other submissions. | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-5** | Not easily fixable without new research. Mitigate by (a) reframing the governance typology as an original analytical contribution and (b) adding a brief limitations paragraph that positions the paper as a "framework-building" contribution that future empirical work can test. |
| IPR-C7 | **Discussion section is thin on European policy specifics.** The "Implications for European Policy" subsection (Section 7.2) makes four points but stays at a high level. IPR reviewers will expect more concrete, actionable recommendations for EU policymakers (e.g., specific AI Office priorities, concrete regulatory sandbox design recommendations, specific open-source policy adjustments). | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-5** | Expand the four policy points with one concrete recommendation each. E.g., for the open-source tension: recommend the AI Office publish compliance guidance for open-source providers within 6 months of GPAI provisions taking effect. |
| IPR-C8 | **arXiv preprint must be disclosed.** IPR permits arXiv preprints but expects disclosure. Failure to note the preprint in the submission cover letter could trigger a plagiarism flag if a reviewer finds arXiv:2410.21279. | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-2** | Draft a one-paragraph disclosure note for the IPR submission portal. 10 minutes. |

#### Summary

| Component | Value |

### 7.2 JCP Paper: Estimated Acceptance Probability

**Current estimate: 70--75%**

(Detailed critique analysis in `papers/jcp2026/jcp2026_critiques.md`. All 11 original critiques implemented.)

#### Strengths

- Novel analytical contribution: cyber governance trilemma with formally argued mechanism
- Cyber governance threaded through every case study section (EU/NIS2, China/CAC, US/CISA)
- Comparative regulatory timeline as structured dataset (22 milestones, 2016--2026)
- Substantive developing-nations analysis (5 countries/blocs)
- Dedicated AI-cyber conflict subsection engaging military/security audience
- Chatham House numbered endnotes correctly formatted
- British English verified clean
- Substantive author bios (4--5 sentences each with credentials)
- Word count (6,061) solidly mid-range for JCP's 4,000--8,000 range
- Three passes of humanizing edits (75 changes)

#### Outstanding Critiques

| # | Critique | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| JCP-C1 | **Cover letter not yet finalized.** A draft exists at `papers/jcp2026/cover-letter.md` but needs final review to ensure it discloses both the arXiv preprint and the IPR companion paper, and clearly states the distinct contribution. Without it, the submission is incomplete. | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-5** | Review and finalize the cover letter draft. Ensure it names the arXiv preprint (2410.21279), notes the IPR submission, and explains the distinct cyber governance contribution. 30 minutes. |
| JCP-C2 | **Inquiry email to commissioning editor not yet sent.** The recommended strategy (Section 4.1) is to send a 250-word abstract to Joyce Hakmeh before formal submission to gauge editorial appetite. The draft exists (`email-hakmeh.md`) but has not been sent. Submitting without editorial pre-screening raises the risk of a desk rejection on fit grounds. | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-8** | Send the inquiry email. If the response is negative, pivot to alternative venues (Section 5) before investing in formal submission. |
| JCP-C3 | **Shared tables with IPR are still similar in structure.** The China laws table (Table 2) and EU risk description remain structurally similar to the IPR versions. While content overlap has been reduced to ~15--20%, a reviewer who encounters both papers could flag the tables specifically. | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-3** | Add a "cyber governance dimension" column to the China laws table. Restructure the table to foreground the cybersecurity aspects of each regulation (e.g., Cybersecurity Law is already first; add a column noting whether each regulation has cyber-specific provisions). |
| JCP-C4 | **No figures in the paper.** The IPR paper uses 3 figures (decision tree, risk pyramid, SB 1047 timeline). The JCP paper references no figures at all. While not required, a figure illustrating the trilemma (e.g., a triangle diagram showing each jurisdiction's position) or a visual of the governance typology would improve readability and reviewer engagement. | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-3** | Create a simple trilemma triangle figure showing the three objectives at vertices and each jurisdiction's position. Or create a 2x2 governance typology figure with each jurisdiction plotted. |
| JCP-C5 | **No DOCX with properly rendered endnotes.** JCP likely reviews DOCX submissions. The current pandoc DOCX conversion does not produce properly numbered endnotes from the LaTeX source --- pandoc converts `\endnote` calls to plain text rather than Word endnote fields. Reviewers receiving a DOCX with broken endnotes may be frustrated. | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-4** | Either (a) submit the PDF instead of DOCX, or (b) post-process the DOCX to convert endnote text into Word endnote fields (manual or scripted). Check JCP's preferred submission format. |
| JCP-C6 | **Trilemma mechanism could be stronger.** The formal argument (Section 8, paragraphs on three bilateral tensions) is good but stops short of empirical validation. A reviewer could argue that the trilemma is a useful heuristic rather than a demonstrated structural constraint. The Mundell-Fleming analogy is mentioned once but not developed. | ACCEPTANCE_PROBABILITY_PERCENT: **-5** | Add 2--3 sentences developing the Mundell-Fleming analogy more explicitly: just as countries cannot simultaneously maintain fixed exchange rates, free capital flows, and independent monetary policy, AI-governing jurisdictions cannot simultaneously maintain... Cite Rodrik's globalisation trilemma as a closer political economy parallel. |

#### Summary
