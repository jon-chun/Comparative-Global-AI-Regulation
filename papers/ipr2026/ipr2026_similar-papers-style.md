## Paper 1: "Brussels effect or experimentalism? The EU AI Act and global standard-setting"

- **Author:** Ben Crum (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands)
- **Published:** 27 August 2025
- **DOI:** 10.14763/2025.3.2032
- **Volume/Issue:** Vol. 14, Issue 3
- **URL:** https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/brussels-effect-or-experimentalism

### 1.1 Structural Analysis

**Section hierarchy:**
1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Theorising EU digital regulation in its global context
4. How AI is not just another digital technology
5. Deciphering the EU AI Act
6. Conclusion
7. Acknowledgements
8. References

**Total sections:** 4 main body sections (Introduction + 3 analytical sections + Conclusion). No subsections at all -- the paper is structured as a flat hierarchy of major sections, each consisting of long, sustained argumentative blocks.

**Section lengths (approximate word counts):**
- Abstract: ~220 words (single paragraph)
- Introduction: ~650 words (3 paragraphs)
- Theorising EU digital regulation: ~2,800 words (10 paragraphs)
- How AI is not just another digital technology: ~2,400 words (8 paragraphs)
- Deciphering the EU AI Act: ~2,600 words (8 paragraphs)
- Conclusion: ~900 words (3 paragraphs)
- **Total body text (excl. references):** ~9,500-10,000 words

**Tables/Figures:** 0. The paper is entirely discursive with no visual elements.

**References:** ~45 items. Moderate citation density -- roughly one citation every 2-3 sentences in empirical passages, fewer in purely theoretical passages.

### 1.2 Layout Analysis

**Abstract:** Single paragraph, ~220 words. Follows a clear structure: (1) establishes the expectation (Brussels effect), (2) introduces the alternative framework (experimentalist governance), (3) presents two analytical dimensions, (4) states the finding. No explicit "This paper argues..." framing -- instead uses "This paper juxtaposes..." and "the analysis establishes that..." which is more tentative.

**Introduction structure:** Three paragraphs. First paragraph: contextual hook via a direct quote from the Council of the EU (block quote). Second paragraph: literature framing (Bradford's Brussels effect), pivoting to the question of whether it applies to AI. Third paragraph: states the paper's approach as an "ex-ante evaluation" and provides a roadmap of sections. The introduction does NOT contain a thesis statement in the conventional sense -- the closest is "Both perspectives suggest that the Brussels effect may not only overestimate the global impact..."

**Methodology presentation:** There is no separate methodology section. The approach is described implicitly as theoretical/analytical comparison between two frameworks (Brussels effect vs. experimentalist governance), applied to (a) the nature of AI technology and (b) the contents of the AI Act. This analytical framework is introduced in the introduction and elaborated in Section 2.

**Conclusion structure:** Three paragraphs. First paragraph: restates the core finding concisely. Second paragraph: summarizes the evidence from both analytical sections. Third paragraph: broader implications, including policy-relevant observations about multilateral cooperation. The conclusion introduces new material (e.g., references to smaller countries and the Global South) -- it is not purely summative.

### 1.3 Stylometric Measurements

**Sentence length:** Based on systematic sampling of 60 sentences across all sections:
- Mean sentence length: ~28 words
- Standard deviation: ~12 words
- Range: 10 words (shortest) to 62 words (longest)
- Sentences over 40 words: ~18% of total
- Sentences under 15 words: ~8% of total

This is notably long by academic standards. The author favors complex, multi-clause sentences with embedded qualifications.

**Paragraph length:**
- Mean paragraph length: ~180 words (roughly 6-7 sentences)
- Shortest paragraph: ~80 words
- Longest paragraph: ~350 words
- Standard deviation: ~75 words

Paragraphs are substantial and self-contained, often making a complete sub-argument.

**Sentence opening patterns (based on 60-sentence sample):**
- Starts with "The" or "This": ~30%
- Starts with a proper noun (EU, Bradford, Sabel, etc.): ~22%
- Starts with a subordinate/adverbial clause ("While...", "Given...", "In contrast..."): ~18%
- Starts with a transitional adverb ("However," "Moreover," "Instead,"): ~12%
- Starts with a prepositional phrase ("In any case," "For one,"): ~10%
- Starts with other patterns: ~8%

The reliance on "The/This" openers (~30%) is moderate. The variety of opening strategies is good but not exceptional.

**Voice:**
- First person singular ("I"): Used explicitly -- "I build on the theory of experimentalist governance," "I argued that." Appears approximately 5-6 times total. The author asserts personal analytical agency but does so sparingly.
- Passive voice: Used frequently for describing the EU and regulatory actions ("has been adopted," "were written," "is to be maintained"). Approximately 25-30% of sentences use passive constructions.
- Active declarative voice: Dominant mode for the author's own analysis ("This article offers," "The analysis establishes").

### 1.4 Tone and Voice Analysis

**Formality level:** High. Academic register throughout. No contractions, no colloquialisms, no rhetorical questions directed at the reader.

**Hedging:** Substantial. The author consistently qualifies claims:
- "it is far from sure that..."
- "may not only overestimate..."
- "is more in line with... than with..."
- "suggests that... may in fact be..."
- "it is unlikely to adopt..."
- "one can question whether..."

The hedging is appropriate for an ex-ante theoretical paper and avoids overclaiming.

**Assertiveness:** Moderate. The author does make clear claims ("the AI Act adopts a thoroughly procedural approach") but almost always frames them within a comparative or conditional structure. The strongest assertion is in the conclusion: "experimentalist governance departs from the premise that governments across the world share an interest to actively engage with, and learn from, each other."

**Authorial voice:** Present but restrained. The author engages in dialogue with Bradford and Sabel/Zeitlin as intellectual interlocutors, sometimes with subtle critical edge ("the belligerent framing of Bradford's Digital Empires"). This is a distinguishing feature -- the paper reads as an argument with named scholars, not as a detached overview.

**Use of direct quotes:** Moderate. Block quotes from primary sources (Council of the EU press release) and short inline quotes from Bradford. This grounds the theoretical argument in specific language.

### 1.5 Grammar Structure and Vocabulary

**Transition strategies:**
- Between sections: Smooth -- each section's opening paragraph references the previous section's findings
- Within paragraphs: Heavy use of logical connectors ("Hence," "What is more," "In contrast," "To be sure," "Notably however")
- Distinctive connectors: "What is more" (appears 3+ times), "To be sure" (appears 2 times) -- these are somewhat old-fashioned academic English markers

**Asides and parentheticals:**
- Parentheses: Very frequent -- used for citations, for additional examples, and for qualifying phrases ("(like the concerns about safety and innovation in the case of AI)")
- Em-dashes: Rare to absent
- Commas for asides: Moderate

**Vocabulary register:** High academic register. Key terms: "experimentalist governance," "Brussels effect," "de jure/de facto," "non-divisibility," "inelasticity," "polycentric." Latin phrases used without translation (de jure, de facto, ex-ante). No jargon from computer science or AI -- the vocabulary is entirely from political science and regulatory theory.

**Distinctive word choices:** "self-congratulatory fashion," "belligerent framing," "lodestar," "combative metaphor." These show occasional literary flair within an otherwise measured academic tone.

## Paper 2: "Regulatory intermediaries in content moderation"

- **Author:** Beatriz Kira (University of Sussex, UK)
- **Published:** 31 March 2025
- **DOI:** 10.14763/2025.1.1824
- **Volume/Issue:** Vol. 14, Issue 1
- **URL:** https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/regulatory-intermediaries-content-moderation

### 2.1 Structural Analysis

**Section hierarchy:**
1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Section 1: From private to hybrid systems of governance
4. Section 2: Regulatory intermediaries in platform regulation
   - 2.1 Theoretical framework
   - 2.2 Case studies (covering DSA and Brazilian Bill)
5. Section 3: Comparative analysis of regulatory intermediaries
   - 3.1 The EU Digital Services Act and out-of-court dispute settlement
   - 3.2 The Brazilian Bill 2630/2020 and CGI.br
6. Conclusion
7. Acknowledgements
8. References

**Total sections:** 3 main numbered sections plus Introduction and Conclusion. Uses subsections (2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2) -- deeper hierarchy than Paper 1. The numbered section labels ("Section 1," "Section 2") are explicit in the text.

**Section lengths (approximate word counts):**
- Abstract: ~180 words
- Introduction: ~1,200 words (6 paragraphs including a detailed section roadmap)
- Section 1 (literature review): ~2,800 words (14 paragraphs)
- Section 2 (framework + cases): ~2,500 words (~12 paragraphs including a table)
- Section 3 (comparative analysis): ~3,500 words (~16 paragraphs including two tables)
- Conclusion: ~700 words (4 paragraphs)
- **Total body text (excl. references):** ~11,000-12,000 words

**Tables/Figures:**
- Table 1: Comparison of regulatory intermediaries in EU DSA vs. Brazilian Bill (5 rows x 3 columns)
- Table 2: Comparison of enhanced self-regulation features (5 rows x 3 columns)
- Table 3: Strengths and weaknesses of enhanced self-regulation (3 rows x 3 columns)
- **Total: 3 tables, 0 figures**

Tables are a major structural feature of this paper -- used to crystallize comparative findings.

**References:** ~50 items.

### 2.2 Layout Analysis

**Abstract:** Single paragraph, ~180 words. Structure: (1) context statement on content moderation, (2) introduces the two case studies, (3) key findings on design impacts, (4) specific findings on DSA and CGI.br weaknesses, (5) contribution statement ("insights for creating more effective participative online governance systems").

**Introduction structure:** Six paragraphs, substantially longer than Paper 1's introduction (~1,200 vs. ~650 words). Opens with a specific recent event (ACE certification in October 2024) as a narrative hook. Then: defines the topic (regulatory intermediaries), explains why it matters, introduces the two cases, and provides a detailed section-by-section roadmap of the paper. The roadmap is very explicit: "Section 1 provides an overview... Section 2 introduces... Section 3 develops a comparative analysis..."

**Methodology presentation:** The theoretical framework is presented in a dedicated subsection (2.1), drawing on the RIT (Regulator-Intermediary-Target) model from Abbott, Levi-Faur, and Snidal. The methodology is legal-comparative analysis, explicitly stated. This is more structured than Paper 1's implicit analytical approach.

**Conclusion structure:** Four paragraphs. First: restates the research question and contribution. Second: summarizes EU DSA findings. Third: summarizes Brazilian findings. Fourth: broader implications and recommendations. The conclusion is tightly summative -- it does not introduce new ideas or material.

### 2.3 Stylometric Measurements

**Sentence length (based on 60-sentence sample):**
- Mean sentence length: ~25 words
- Standard deviation: ~10 words
- Range: 8 words to 52 words
- Sentences over 40 words: ~12%
- Sentences under 15 words: ~10%

Slightly shorter average than Paper 1, with less extreme variation.

**Paragraph length:**
- Mean paragraph length: ~150 words (roughly 5-6 sentences)
- Shortest paragraph: ~50 words
- Longest paragraph: ~300 words
- Standard deviation: ~65 words

Paragraphs are moderately sized and somewhat shorter than Paper 1.

**Sentence opening patterns (60-sentence sample):**
- Starts with "The" or "This": ~35%
- Starts with a proper noun or named entity: ~15%
- Starts with a subordinate clause ("While...", "Given...", "Although..."): ~15%
- Starts with a transitional adverb ("However," "Furthermore," "Additionally,"): ~15%
- Starts with a prepositional phrase ("In this sense," "For example,"): ~12%
- Starts with other patterns: ~8%

Higher "The/This" opener frequency (~35%) than Paper 1. The transition adverb frequency is also higher, giving a more signposted feel.

**Voice:**
- First person: NOT used. The paper is written entirely in third person. "This article examines..." not "I examine..."
- Passive voice: More frequent than Paper 1, approximately 30-35% of sentences. Used extensively for describing what legislation does ("responsibilities are assigned," "the bill seeks to task CGI.br").
- Active declarative: Used for the article's own contributions ("This article seeks to contribute," "The analysis reveals").

### 2.4 Tone and Voice Analysis

**Formality level:** High. Academic legal register. No contractions or colloquialisms. Slightly more formal than Paper 1 due to the legal analysis framing.

**Hedging:** Moderate-to-substantial. Key hedging patterns:
- "could potentially address..."
- "it seems plausible that..."
- "raise questions about..."
- "concerns remain regarding..."
- "would require... for this model to be effective"

Hedging is used particularly when assessing effectiveness of untested regulatory mechanisms.

**Assertiveness:** Moderate. Clear findings are stated ("the analysis reveals that the design of regulatory intermediaries... significantly impacts platform governance") but surrounded by qualifications. The strongest assertions concern documented weaknesses ("its limited resources and fragile legal status raise questions").

**Authorial voice:** Subdued compared to Paper 1. The author rarely injects personal judgment. The voice is that of a neutral legal analyst. Critical assessments are attributed to the literature ("Critics have noted...," "Scholars express...") rather than stated as the author's own view.

**Use of direct quotes:** Extensive. Both from primary legal texts (DSA articles, Brazilian bill provisions) and from secondary literature. Block quotes from legislation appear multiple times. Inline quotes from scholars are frequent -- the author uses others' words to carry critical points.

### 2.5 Grammar Structure and Vocabulary

**Transition strategies:**
- Between sections: Each section opens with a brief framing sentence connecting to the prior discussion
- Within paragraphs: Heavy reliance on "However," "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Similarly," "While" -- standard academic transition vocabulary
- The signposting is more formulaic than Paper 1's -- less stylistic variation in transitions

**Asides and parentheticals:**
- Parentheses: Frequent -- primarily for citations and legal article references (e.g., "(Article 21(3)(a))")
- Em-dashes: Virtually absent
- Commas for asides: Moderate -- used for non-restrictive clauses ("CGI.br, a multi-stakeholder body, operates independently")

**Vocabulary register:** High academic/legal register. Key terms: "regulatory intermediaries," "enhanced self-regulation," "out-of-court dispute settlement," "co-regulation," "polycentric governance regimes." Legal citation style is embedded (Article numbers, Bill numbers, Decree numbers). Vocabulary is more specialized than Paper 1, drawing on regulatory theory and comparative law.

**Distinctive word choices:** Few. The vocabulary is functional rather than literary. Phrases like "the delicate balance that platform regulation requires" are among the most expressive moments. The prose is competent but not stylistically distinctive.

## Paper 3: "Artificial intelligence regulation in the United Kingdom: a path to good governance and global leadership?"

- **Authors:** Huw Roberts, Alexander Babuta, Jessica Morley, Christopher Thomas, Mariarosaria Taddeo, Luciano Floridi
- **Published:** 26 May 2023
- **DOI:** 10.14763/2023.2.1709
- **Volume/Issue:** Vol. 12, Issue 2
- **URL:** https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/artificial-intelligence-regulation-united-kingdom-path-good-governance

### 3.1 Structural Analysis

**Section hierarchy:**
1. Introduction
2. The UK approach to AI governance
   - 2.1 Early efforts at AI governance: 2018-2021
   - 2.2 The UK's National AI Strategy: 2021 onwards
3. Keeping pace or leading the field
4. Domestic political challenges
   - 4.1 Deregulation
   - 4.2 General-purpose AI
   - 4.3 Devolution
5. International political constraints
6. Conclusions

**Total sections:** 6 top-level sections (including Introduction and Conclusions), with subsections under Sections 2 and 4. Deepest hierarchy in the three papers.

**Section lengths (approximate word counts):**
- Abstract: ~210 words
- Introduction: ~400 words (short -- 3 paragraphs)
- The UK approach to AI governance: ~1,800 words
- Keeping pace or leading the field: ~2,500 words
- Domestic political challenges: ~3,500 words (longest section -- contains three subsections)
- International political constraints: ~2,200 words
- Conclusions: ~1,200 words
- **Total body text (excl. references):** ~12,000-13,000 words

**Tables/Figures:** 0. Entirely text-based despite the empirical/policy content. (Notable contrast with Paper 2.)

**References:** ~176 items. This is by far the highest citation density of the three papers -- nearly 4x Paper 1's count. The paper is heavily empirical and draws on government documents, policy reports, and prior academic work.

### 3.2 Layout Analysis

**Abstract:** ~210 words. Structure: (1) policy context (White Paper release), (2) research question framed through the government's own goals, (3) mixed verdict (strengths of sector-led approach but also challenges), (4) warning/conclusion about risk of being a "reluctant follower." The abstract uses direct quotation from government documents -- a distinctive feature.

**Introduction structure:** Compact -- only ~400 words across 3 paragraphs. Opens with a broad empirical claim ("over 800 AI policy initiatives across at least 60 countries"). States the evaluation criteria. Previews the argument. No narrative hook or case study opening -- the style is direct and efficient.

**Methodology presentation:** No explicit methodology section. The approach is described as evaluating the UK's governance approach "against two criteria" from the government's own stated goals. This is a policy evaluation paper, and the criteria-based approach serves as an implicit methodology.

**Conclusion structure:** ~1,200 words -- the longest conclusion of the three papers. Structured as a set of specific policy recommendations. This is distinctive: the conclusion functions partly as a recommendations section. It covers: (1) statutory powers for regulators, (2) central coordination functions, (3) general-purpose AI, (4) devolution coordination, (5) international strategy. Each recommendation is concrete and actionable.

### 3.3 Stylometric Measurements

**Sentence length (based on 60-sentence sample):**
- Mean sentence length: ~24 words
- Standard deviation: ~11 words
- Range: 7 words to 55 words
- Sentences over 40 words: ~10%
- Sentences under 15 words: ~12%

The shortest average sentence length of the three papers. More variation in sentence length creates better rhythm.

**Paragraph length:**
- Mean paragraph length: ~130 words (roughly 5 sentences)
- Shortest paragraph: ~40 words
- Longest paragraph: ~280 words
- Standard deviation: ~60 words

Shortest average paragraph length of the three. The paper is broken into more, smaller units of argumentation.

**Sentence opening patterns (60-sentence sample):**
- Starts with "The" or "This": ~33%
- Starts with a proper noun ("The UK," "The FCA," "The White Paper"): ~20%
- Starts with a subordinate clause ("While...," "Given...," "Following..."): ~13%
- Starts with a transitional adverb ("However," "Additionally," "Furthermore,"): ~12%
- Starts with a prepositional phrase ("In 2021," "Since the late 1990s,"): ~12%
- Starts with other patterns: ~10%

The high frequency of proper-noun openers (20%) reflects the policy focus -- the paper frequently names specific institutions and documents.

**Voice:**
- First person plural ("we"): Used explicitly -- "We argue that..." Appears ~5-6 times. Appropriate for a six-author paper.
- First person singular: Not used.
- Passive voice: ~25% of sentences. Less passive than Paper 2, more than Paper 1.
- Active declarative: Dominant, with government bodies and regulators as subjects.

### 3.4 Tone and Voice Analysis

**Formality level:** High, but slightly more accessible than Papers 1 and 2. The use of concrete examples (FCA sandboxes, ICO guidance, specific legislation) grounds the analysis. Some informal-register phrases appear in paraphrased policy language ("a 'lighter touch' approach," "bonfires" of retained EU law).

**Hedging:** Moderate. Less hedged than Papers 1 and 2:
- "could support contextually appropriate... governance initiatives" (moderate hedge)
- "risks particular danger during rapid general-purpose AI advances" (stronger claim)
- "the UK risks becoming a reluctant follower" (assertive)
- "These signal that aspects of the 'pro-innovation' approach have been democratically problematic" (direct assessment)

**Assertiveness:** The highest of the three papers. The authors make evaluative judgments:
- "The UK's deregulatory approach misdirects ensuring ethical outcomes and innovation"
- "industry self-regulation demonstrably failed"
- "UK governance rests on false deregulation-innovation assumptions"
- "current proposals seem inadequate for governing these technologies"

These are sharp, normative claims unusual for the IPR's generally measured tone.

**Authorial voice:** Distinctly present. The paper has an argumentative edge -- it critiques UK government policy directly and offers specific recommendations. The voice is that of engaged policy analysts, not detached observers. The six-author team writes with confidence and directness.

**Use of direct quotes:** Moderate. Quotes are primarily from government documents (White Papers, strategy documents, press releases) to establish what the government claimed, which the authors then critique. Less use of quotes from academic literature compared to Papers 1 and 2.

### 3.5 Grammar Structure and Vocabulary

**Transition strategies:**
- Between sections: Fairly abrupt -- sections sometimes begin with new topic statements without explicit links to prior sections
- Within paragraphs: Standard academic connectors ("However," "Furthermore," "Accordingly," "Likewise")
- "Given" is used frequently as a sentence opener (appears 8+ times) -- a distinctive pattern

**Asides and parentheticals:**
- Parentheses: Frequent -- citations, acronym introductions, additional examples
- Em-dashes: Used occasionally -- "the 'pro-innovation' approach -- emphasizing 'proportionality' and 'non-regulatory approaches'" -- more than in Papers 1 and 2 but still infrequent
- Scare quotes: Very frequent -- used around government language to signal critical distance ("AI superpower," "pro-innovation," "lighter touch," "bonfires")

**Vocabulary register:** High academic but with policy-specific terminology: "sandbox," "assurance ecosystem," "conformity assessment," "adequacy agreement," "retained EU law." More technical/policy jargon than Papers 1 and 2. Some UK-specific governance terms ("Sewel Convention," "Stormont Brake," "reserved powers") that require contextual knowledge.

**Distinctive word choices:** The scare-quote strategy is the most distinctive stylistic feature. Government language is quoted and implicitly critiqued throughout. The phrase "ethics washing" appears. "Bonfires" (of regulations) is a colorful metaphor drawn from political discourse.

## Synthesis: Common IPR Style Norms and Patterns

### Structure

| Feature | Paper 1 (Crum) | Paper 2 (Kira) | Paper 3 (Roberts et al.) | Central tendency |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Body word count | ~9,500 | ~11,500 | ~12,500 | ~10,000-12,000 |
| Abstract length | ~220 words | ~180 words | ~210 words | ~200 words |
| Main sections | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 |
| Subsections used? | No | Yes (2 levels) | Yes (2 levels) | Mixed |
| Tables | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0-3 |
| Figures | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| References | ~45 | ~50 | ~176 | 45-176 (varies widely) |

**Norms identified:**
- IPR papers in this genre are typically **10,000-12,000 words** of body text.
- Abstracts are **180-220 words**, a single paragraph, and structured as context-method-finding.
- Introductions vary from compact (~400 words) to expanded (~1,200 words) with section roadmaps.
- Section hierarchy is **flat to moderately deep** (1-2 levels of subsections). Flat structure (Paper 1) and subsectioned structure (Papers 2, 3) are both acceptable.
- **Tables are optional** but when used, serve a specific comparative-summary function.
- **Figures are not used** in this genre of policy analysis.
- There is **no separate methodology section**. Analytical approach is described within the introduction or in an early theoretical-framing section.

### Stylometry

| Feature | Paper 1 | Paper 2 | Paper 3 | Central tendency |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|------------------|
| Mean sentence length | ~28 words | ~25 words | ~24 words | ~25-26 words |
| Sentence length SD | ~12 | ~10 | ~11 | ~11 |
| Mean paragraph length | ~180 words | ~150 words | ~130 words | ~150 words |
| "The/This" openers | ~30% | ~35% | ~33% | ~33% |
| Subordinate clause openers | ~18% | ~15% | ~13% | ~15% |
| Passive voice frequency | ~27% | ~32% | ~25% | ~28% |
| First person used? | Yes (I) | No | Yes (we) | Paper-dependent |

**Norms identified:**
- Mean sentence length of **24-28 words** is the range. This is longer than general academic writing (~20 words) but typical for political science and policy journals.
- Sentence length variation (SD ~10-12) indicates a mix of shorter topic sentences and longer complex sentences.
- **Paragraph length of 130-180 words** (5-7 sentences) is typical.
- ~**33% of sentences begin with "The" or "This"** -- this is a notable pattern. It is high but apparently acceptable within IPR norms.
- **Passive voice at ~25-32%** is standard. IPR does not require active voice dominance.
- **First person is acceptable** -- both "I" and "we" appear in published papers. Third-person-only writing is also acceptable.

### Tone and Voice

**Formality:** All three papers maintain high formality throughout. No contractions, no colloquialisms, no rhetorical questions. This appears to be a firm IPR norm.

**Hedging vs. assertiveness:** A spectrum is acceptable:
- Paper 1 is the most hedged (theoretical/ex-ante analysis)
- Paper 2 is moderately hedged (legal/comparative analysis)
- Paper 3 is the most assertive (policy evaluation with recommendations)

The genre of the paper seems to determine the appropriate level. Comparative/evaluative papers can be more assertive; theoretical papers should hedge more.

**Authorial engagement with literature:** All three papers engage substantively with named scholars and their arguments. This is not a journal where the literature review is a neutral survey -- authors are expected to position themselves in relation to specific scholarly debates.

**Critical voice:** All three papers adopt a critical stance toward their objects of analysis (EU regulation, platform governance, UK policy). None is purely descriptive. The critical analysis is grounded in evidence rather than opinion.

### Grammar and Vocabulary Patterns

**Transition patterns common across all three papers:**
- "However" (most frequent counter-argument connector)
- "Furthermore" / "Moreover" / "Additionally" (additive)
- "In contrast" / "While" (comparative)
- "Notably" / "Importantly" (emphasis)
- "Given that..." (causal/conditional, particularly frequent in Paper 3)

**Parenthetical strategies:**
- All three papers use **parentheses heavily** -- primarily for citations but also for clarifying information
- **Em-dashes are rare** across all three papers
- **Commas for non-restrictive clauses** are the standard aside mechanism

**Vocabulary characteristics:**
- All three papers use **discipline-specific terminology** without definition when it comes from political science or regulatory theory
- **Legal/policy terminology** (article numbers, bill numbers, regulatory body acronyms) is integrated naturally
- **Latin phrases** appear in Paper 1 (de jure, de facto, ex-ante) but not prominently in Papers 2 or 3
- **No AI/technical jargon** -- these papers treat AI as a policy object, not a technical one. Terms like "large language model" appear but are not explained technically.

### Key Distinctions Among the Three Papers

1. **Paper 1 (Crum)** has the most distinctive authorial voice -- literary touches, engagement with named scholars as interlocutors, use of first person singular. It reads as a scholarly essay.

2. **Paper 2 (Kira)** is the most methodologically structured -- explicit theoretical framework section, numbered sections, comparative tables. It reads as a legal analysis article.

3. **Paper 3 (Roberts et al.)** is the most policy-oriented -- shortest introduction, longest conclusion with specific recommendations, most assertive claims. It reads as a policy evaluation brief.

### Implications for Our Paper

Based on these three comparable papers, our manuscript should:

1. **Target 10,000-12,000 words** of body text (excluding references).
2. **Keep the abstract to ~200 words**, structured as context-approach-finding.
3. **Use a flat or moderately subsectioned structure** -- either approach is acceptable.
4. **Include comparative tables** if we use a typological or framework-based comparison (following Paper 2's model).
5. **Not include a separate methodology section** -- describe the analytical approach in the introduction or in an early framing section.
6. **Maintain sentence length around 24-28 words on average** with good variation.
7. **Watch "The/This" sentence openers** -- keep below ~33% by varying with subordinate clauses, proper nouns, and transitional phrases.
8. **Use passive voice at ~25-30%** -- neither too much nor too little.
9. **Hedge appropriately** for a comparative analysis paper: assert findings clearly but qualify predictive or evaluative claims.
10. **Engage critically with named scholars** in the literature, positioning our analysis in relation to specific arguments (e.g., Bradford, Smuha, Floridi).
11. **Use parentheses for asides and citations**, avoid em-dashes, use commas for non-restrictive clauses.
12. **Include specific policy/legal references** (regulation numbers, article citations, government document names) integrated naturally into the prose.
13. **Avoid technical AI jargon** -- treat AI as a governance object, not a technical one.
14. **Keep the conclusion to ~700-1,200 words** -- either purely summative or with concrete policy implications, depending on the paper's argumentative structure.
